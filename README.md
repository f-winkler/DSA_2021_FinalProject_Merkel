# DSA Final Project: Analyzing Angela Merkel's Speeches Using NLP
A project by Florian Winkler (f-winkler), Jiayu Yang (Zeitgeist-hash), Nassim Zoueini (???) and Johanna Mehler (j-mehler)

This is the repository for our final project in the GRAD-C9 Data Structures and Algorithms class.

After four terms in office, Chancellor Angela Merkel will soon exit the political stage she has led for sixteen years, kickstarting much debate about her legacy for Germany, Europe, and the world. To gain a better understanding of her legacy, this project seeks to analyse Angela Merkel’s speeches using natural language processing (NLP) methods such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis. The project aims at answering policy-relevant questions such as: How have political priorities changed over four terms of Angela Merkel’s chancellorship? How did her speeches change tone in response to significant historical events during her mandate (e.g., global financial crisis 2008/09, Fukushima nuclear disaster 2011, refugee crisis 2015, Covid-19)?
