# DSA Final Project: Analyzing Angela Merkel's Speeches Using NLP
A project by Johanna Mehler (j-mehler), Florian Winkler (f-winkler), Jiayu Yang (Zeitgeist-hash) and Nassim Zoueini (nassimzoueini) 

This is the repository for our final project in the GRAD-C9 Data Structures and Algorithms class.

After four terms in office, former German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently exited the political stage she had led for sixteen years, kickstarting much debate about her legacy for Germany, Europe, and the world. To gain a better understanding of her legacy, this project seeks to analyze Angela Merkel’s speeches using natural language processing (NLP) methods such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis. The project aims at answering policy-relevant questions such as: How have political priorities changed over four terms of Angela Merkel’s chancellorship? How did her speeches change tone in response to significant historical events during her mandate (e.g., global financial crisis 2008/09, Fukushima nuclear disaster 2011, refugee crisis 2015, Covid-19)?
