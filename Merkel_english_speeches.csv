"1","doc7211","Excellencies,  Ladies and gentlemen,  It gives me great pleasure to bid you welcome to the Federal Chancellery for the traditional New Years reception.   I say this also on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office and Minister of State Cornelia Pieper.    Regrettably, tonights reception is overshadowed by terrible news from Moscow.   This afternoon, several people died as a result of a cowardly attack on Domodedovo International Airport in Moscow.   The Federal Government condemns that attack in the strongest possible terms.   We wish to express our condolences to the families of those who are wounded or have died.   Naturally, we will offer the Russian Government assistance in their investigations.   I have already communicated my sympathies to the Russian President.    Ladies and gentlemen, Excellencies, please allow me all the same to use the opportunity of this reception to simply express my thanks to all of you.   Thank you for your many different activities in building bridges between our countries.   Thank you for your daily work and for what you do for your countries in Germany and also for the elements of Germany which you transport to your own country and the image of us you convey.    You bring your home countries and your culture closer to us.   As a result, confidence can be strengthened and mutual understanding improved, partnerships can be filled with life and friendships develop.   Those are preconditions for healthy cooperation.   That cooperation increases in importance from year to year, for what we call globalization reflects nothing other than the fact that we are drawn over closer together, that no-one can have a conflict at home which others are not affected by and that consequently we seek to and we have to put ourselves in the position of others.    If I may make this point on behalf of the German Federal Government: our political goal is to be involved in shaping the process of globalization.   We do not wish to surrender and simply accept it.   Instead, we seek to shape that process for the benefit of people in Germany and for the benefit of people in every other country, too.   We know that as an individual country we cannot do this alone.   It is only possible if we join forces with others, be it in dealing with the major challenges of climate change, the consequences of the international financial and economic crisis or issues of security and stability.    The financial crisis made one thing particularly clear.   Given the increasingly close links between national economies, there is a need to establish common regulatory principles governing market forces at international level.   Having experienced the success of the social market economy model since our countrys founding, we Germans wish to raise awareness at the international level of the values on which that social market economy is based.   We believe that people should shape the economic order rather than simply surrendering to market forces.    Over the last couple of years we have achieved a considerable amount at international level since the international economic and financial crisis struck.   Within the G20 we have made significant progress.   But, in my view, with the regulatory framework we have in place we still cannot always keep pace with global developments although we have improved.    Experience has demonstrated that common action undertaken by all countries  -  the G20 is simply an example, naturally, such action is taken in many other contexts, too, for example in the United Nations and other alliances  -  can overcome even the most difficult crises.   It was successful in the international stabilization of the banks.   It was successful also in establishing economic stimulus packages.   Now we must show that we have learned for the long-term the lessons which result from that crisis.   That means that we will not allow financial forces to drive us repeatedly into such a situation.   There have been many such lessons to learn.    Now the task facing us is to achieve sustainable economic growth for all countries to share.   One of the most important preconditions for that is free trade.   That is, we do not brick up the walls, seal ourselves in and erect barriers but are willing to approach others openly, to engage in fair competition and in the areas in which other countries have products which are good to import these into our country.   The same applies the other way round.    We know that in the 1930s following the Great Depression a serious mistake was made.   Following the introduction of major economic stimulus schemes, economies became sealed off too rigidly from one another.   That led to a repeated collapse of the global economy.   That is why for us it is crucially important that the Doha negotiations are successful.   2011 is a critical year in that respect.   We discussed that at the last meeting of the G20.    I wish to state expressly that we intend to support both the French presidency of the G20 and the French presidency of the G8.   President Sarkozy announced his programme today for these presidencies.   Germany will support France in general and, in particular, Germany together with France will seek to ensure that the long-term stability of currencies, stability in world trade and stability in growth can be achieved.   We also support the French presidency on the issues of migration, Internet security, innovation and green growth and likewise on the issues of fair commodity prices, combating commodity speculation, a stable system of currencies and intergovernmental cooperation.    The most important framework for our cooperation is the United Nations as I have repeatedly said in previous years.   I believe that on its founding the United Nations achieved something altogether wonderful and unique, that is, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   The International Bill of Human Rights tells us that human dignity must be central to our political considerations and our political actions.   What does that mean? It means that all human beings are important, that they have basic rights and that these rights must be accepted.    We know that in many cases difficult processes have to be gone through in order to reach worthwhile outcomes.   This can be seen with the annual conferences on climate change.   We are very pleased that in Cancún in Mexico some progress could be achieved.   Germany sought to make a constructive contribution in that regard.   However, when we look at the commitments of the individual countries, we are still a long way removed from the goal of ensuring that by 2050 global temperatures have not risen by more than two degrees Celsius.   That is why efforts have to be maintained.   Germany intends to play an active role in that regard in the months leading up to the climate change conference in South Africa.    Germany is preparing for increased responsibilities in 2011 und 2012.   We have a non-permanent seat in the Security Council of the United Nations.   For us, that means we have a responsibility.   For us, that means we have a task.   I should like to thank all those who supported us on our path to that seat.   We will do all that we can to live up to our responsibility, to make good use of these two years and to assist the United Nations in making progress towards reform.    The list of the tasks ahead of us is long.    First of all, in Europe, we naturally pay particular attention to our neighbouring continent of Africa.   Day after day, there are people who flee across the Mediterranean in the hope of a better future.    We held our breath when we heard the news from Tunisia.   We hope that there will be a peaceful and democratic development in your country.   We admire the courage of many people.   I already mentioned the International Bill of Human Rights.   In that connection, we hope that rights such as the freedom to demonstrate and electoral freedom will be a reality in your country, too.   That is why we will support you with all the means we have.    Naturally, we have taken note of the crisis in Côte dIvoire and hope that here, too, a sensible solution prevails.   We will cooperate very closely with the African Union as we cannot risk instability in the region.   We have also observed the peaceful conditions in which the referendum in Sudan has taken place.   The Federal Governments Director-General for African Affairs intends to visit that region and Côte dIvoire.   Germany will seek to provide the neces¬sary support in Sudan and particularly in the emerging country of Southern Sudan.    People in many parts of the world and specifically on the continent of Africa are seeking change.   They are looking for greater self-determination and greater opportunities to participate.   In my view, these are everyday basic rights that everyone should have.   That is the basis on which we will approach our partnership with the countries of Africa.   More specifically, I remain convinced that completion of the Doha round of world trade talks will be of the utmost importance for the African continent.    Following the success of the Federal Governments Latin America Strategy, we are currently working to develop a new strategy on Africa.   In that regard, we will naturally pursue efforts also at European Union level.   Our Development Minister has established standards for cooperation, linking development aid, effective economic cooperation and good governance.   That too is a matter we intend to pursue vigorously.    A second focus I should like to mention is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery vehicles.   The developments of recent years are of grave concern to Germany.   That applies particularly in relation to Irans nuclear programme.   We were very disappointed by the talks which took place in Istanbul at the weekend.   I have to put it in those terms.    I wish to repeat what I have said on many occasions.   It is for Iran to dispel the doubts which exist in relation to its nuclear programme.   That is also the objective of the sanctions agreed in 2010.   Our hand to Iran remains outstretched as we wish sensible and beneficial developments to take place in that country and, above all, for its people.   Here, too, we would like to stress the fact that human rights apply everywhere.   We know that many freedoms are restricted in Iran.   That is why we say very clearly that we would like to see improvements in this area too.   Naturally, our thoughts are also with the two journalists from Germany and we hope that they will soon be free.    Ladies and gentlemen, naturally, there are expectations on the Iranian leadership that we will experience positive developments in these matters.   Otherwise, we will have to continue down the sanctions route.   I can only once again appeal for talks to be more successful than those which took place at the weekend.    A further major issue of concern  -  I have to put it that way  -  and the third point that I wish to mention is the Middle East peace process.   We have had many hopes of progress.   Regrettably, those hopes have not been realized.   Nonetheless, I will continue to staunchly advocate a two-state solution with, on the one hand, a Jewish State of Israel and, on the other hand, a viable Palestinian State.   In my view, that is what reason dictates if stability in the entire region is to be established.    Next week we will travel to the German-Israeli intergovernmental consultations at which we will work together with the Israeli Government on projects in many fields.   Naturally, we will also discuss the progress of the negotiations in the Middle East as that is an area in which we would like to see success.   Germany wishes to play its part in achieving that.    My fourth point concerns Afghanistan.   The country continues to be a focus of attention of the international community.   Bundeswehr operations in Afghanistan remain a major challenge for Germany.   Debates are currently being held in the German Bundestag on the new Afghanistan mandate.    Last week we heard a policy statement by the Development Minister which detailed  -  independently of the military task which remains to be discharged  -  development activities there and what Germany has achieved in that regard.   I believe that drew attention once again to the fact that in Afghanistan much progress has been achieved which tends to get submerged in everyday discussions.   We are pleased to see that many more children can go to school, that roads are under construction and that there are more ways to earn a livelihood.    In Afghanistan we have long pursued the concept of networked security.   That involves close cooperation between the Federal Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Development Ministry and the Ministry of the Interior.   In my view, this is the right approach and one which is pursued also by the international community.   That is why we will continue our operations this year in Afghanistan with a view to ensuring that in 2014 the country is capable of assuming responsibility for security matters.   The steps necessary to achieve that have already been agreed.    Ladies and gentlemen, we want developments in Afghanistan to be a success.   The NATO summit in Lisbon established the necessary conditions.   At the same time a new strategic concept for NATO was agreed.   That was an important step.   The concept of networked security, as already in use in the case of Afghanistan, was also agreed.   At the summit it became apparent, too, that we are in favour of disarmament and arms control.   We want to establish a missile defence system.   We want to meet new challenges such as those of cyber-security.   We want to cooperate closely with partners from beyond our alliance.    These are new approaches.   A clear commitment to disarmament and arms control, security against new threats, a response to new technical possibilities, as can be seen in the case of cyber-defence, and NATO as an alliance which cooperates with other partners.    We take the view that NATO provides us with a guarantee for our security.   It is the strongest pillar of our close transatlantic partnership and friendship, to which we are naturally committed and which we will continue to strengthen.   We say very clearly: our first priority is the prevention of conflict.   In this area, too, NATOs remit will be extended.   The aim is to ensure that conflicts do not even arise.   I believe that this is the modern approach which in the 21st century we have to and certainly will develop further.    Peacekeeping in a wider sense constitutes an important and broad area of our work.   Food security, preventive health care, education, economic development, encouragement of democracy and good governance  -  all of these things are closely interconnected.   I believe that in the present Federal Government we have established very good relationships between the various ministries.   We focus on what is in the interests of the individual country and what we need to do in the areas of scientific cooperation, educational cooperation, development cooperation, environmental cooperation and foreign policy cooperation.   These can not be considered separately but as a parcel for the country in question.   In my view, this joint approach is good for the countries in which we are active.    We acknowledge that we are a prosperous industrial country and that, consequently, we have a particular responsibility.   That is why we are the worlds third largest donor country and have not made cuts in the field of development despite major financial difficulties and austerity budgets.   We remain committed to this work in the future.    Last year and regrettably already also this year we have experienced terrible catastrophes in the wake of floods or earthquakes.   We have sought to provide immediate and rapid assistance to the countries concerned.   I am thinking, for example, of the assistance provided to Pakistan and Haiti.   However, we understand development aid and emergency assistance always to constitute an aid to self-help.   This is something we take very seriously.   I believe that in development aid in the past too little value was placed on this.   To place a greater value on this point must be our priority in the future.    At the summit that I attended on the Millennium Development Goals it became apparent that we still have a lot to achieve.   However, a crucial question, both at the summit and now, is how to go about this.   In a long conversation I had with former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan we discussed how  -  from micro-loans to support for small business start-ups  -  we must always do our utmost to ensure that we do, in fact, bring about self-sustained economic development and help achieve transparency in governance.    Ladies and gentlemen, it would be wrong to suggest that at home here in Germany or in our immediate neighbourhood nothing needs doing.   In Europe, too, we have a lot of work and much ahead of us.   As a result of the international financial and economic crisis, we, too, came to realize our weaknesses.   In the European Union, too, we must learn our lessons from the past and adopt precautionary measures.   Above all, that means that the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact  -  to which there is a long-standing commitment in the European Union treaties  -  must be satisfied.   In that connection, we have tightened the terms of that Stability and Growth Pact.   We need a greater coordination of economic policy, particularly in the Eurozone.   And we need crisis mechanisms to provide assistance to others provided they take measures of their own which are aimed at improving stability and growth.    I am conscious of the fact that certain countries in the Eurozone and in the European Union have had to take very hard corrective measures, not only in Greece where we observe with great respect the action the Greek Government has taken but also in other countries, too, where much has been done.   We are conscious of the fact  -  and I say this as the German Chancellor and on behalf of the entire Federal Government  -  that for us the euro is more than just a currency.   It is an important currency, a currency with worldwide recognition, and also a vital symbol of European unification.   That is why the euro must be defended.   In defending it, we must make the standards of the strongest economies the standards of us all in order to ensure that we are competitive and that stability remains firmly anchored.   Only if we do this will the euro be strong.    We have observed  -  this, too, is a feature of the past year  -  that many countries are now closing the gap and experiencing very dynamic growth.   This applies in particular to Asia.   It applies to China, it applies to India, but I can name other countries, too, for example, Viet Nam.   We, that is, Germany and the whole of the European Union, have established very good and very successful export relationships with those countries.   With them we also maintain a very successful political relationship which notwithstanding our controversial discussions on certain points is growing ever closer.    Whatever we do, we cannot as Germany do alone but must do to a considerable and increasing extent in our capacity as a member of the European Union.   When we talk to China or to India, we are talking to countries with a population of 1.  2 or 1.  3 billion.   In that context it is both beneficial and essential that we have the European Union, that we are 500 million people in Europe who can operate at an international level sharing the same values and the same visions of the future.   That is why we have taken steps to develop a common approach to foreign policy.   The new European External Action Service began work on 1 December 2010.   Through its actions Europe will be able to speak with one voice and the interests of Europe will be jointly represented  -  although at times this may of course be difficult and has to be learned.   I am very optimistic that in this way we will become more successful from one year to the next.    Ladies and gentleman, Excellencies, Alexander von Humboldt once said that the most dangerous view of the world was that held by people who have never really viewed the world.   It is said that such people still exist.   However, I can be extremely sure of the fact that you, our guests this evening, do not fall into that group.   In your lives, you have not only seen Germany and your home countries but the vast majority of you are familiar with many different parts of the world.   As a result, you possess an incredible wealth of experience.   My request to you is the following: do not hesitate to tell us repeatedly what people in your country think, what people in your country feel and what people in your country believe.   If we wish to grow closer together, controversies, disagreements and even arguments, as in every good family, are part of everyday life.   However, let us approach this in a spirit in which we know that, ultimately, we all seek a common solution.   We will only be able to achieve that when we know more about each other, when we have seen more and when we can empathize more with different situations.    I believe that the Internet  -  notwithstanding all the difficulties it brought us over the past year  -  offers us in general the possibility to discover much more quickly even more about the world.   However, travel broadens the mind and from time to time we still intend to visit individual countries in person.   This is something all members of the Federal Government enjoy.   However, I must admit, we cannot always go to all the places to which we have been invited.   I shall attempt again this year to target a few destinations.   I know where my weak points are and where I should have long since been.   As I am not alone, but the Foreign Minister, the Development Minister and many other ministers are also there, we will do our utmost in all the areas I have mentioned  -  foreign policy, development policy, education policy, economic cooperation and in all other fields  -  to cooperate effectively with you.    I wish you a very warm welcome and a healthy, successful and prosperous 2011","Address by Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, at the New Year Reception for the Diplomatic Corps",2011-01-24,"Germany","A.Merkel",3683,"en"
"2","doc73851","in Geneva Mr President, Madam Director-General, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, Theres an ancient proverb that says you should learn before you speak, and take care of yourself before you fall ill.   Some words lose none of their wisdom even over thousands of years.   Health is a human right.   We are all working  -  now and in September  -  to ensure that the right to health is firmly anchored in the UN system as one of the new Sustainable Development Goals.   The German G7 Presidency has also made health a priority issue, which we will address throughout our Presidency.   Why are we doing this? Firstly, because the human right to health can only be enforced if a sustainable health system is in place or is put in place in every country on Earth, and secondly, because globalisation is tangibly making us all more dependent on one another, so that increasingly the health of one person is also the health of others.   In other words, the effectiveness of the health system in one country impacts on the health of other countries, and on security and stability.   The responsibility of individual countries and global shared responsibility are two sides of one and the same coin.   Germany has put three health-related issues on the G7 agenda.   First, in the light of current events, we are asking what lessons can be learned from the Ebola epidemic.   Second, what can we do to better combat poverty-related neglected tropical diseases? And third, what can we do about the increasing resistance to antibiotics? This is an issue for industrialised and developing countries alike.   All three issues have one thing in common.   They can only be successfully addressed if all countries are enabled to comply with the norms set for health systems.   These International Health Regulations have been developed by the World Health Organization.   Their implementation must be made compulsory for all.   They are no mere recommendations.   These Regulations are so good that they just have to be put into practice.   But why are the G7 nations now concerning themselves with something that has already been agreed on at international level? Were picking up on it because we have strong economies, because we G7 states have a high level of scientific expertise, and because we share values that stress the indivisible nature of human dignity, a principle which should not be geographically confined to the G7 countries.   I am thus glad that the German Health Minister and myself have been invited by the World Health Organization to report to you here today on our plans.   The disastrous outbreak of Ebola in West Africa made us painfully aware of how urgently the international community needs to act when crises strike.   26,000 people were infected by the virus, and more than 11,000 people died.   The countries affected have been seriously destabilised.   We can report some initial successes  -  Liberia is now an Ebola-free zone.   We hope the same can soon be said of the other two countries affected.   But the war will only have been won when there are no new infections.   In fact, it will only really be won when we are properly equipped to face the next crisis  -  in other words, when we have learned from this crisis.   One lesson that we all need to learn is that we should have reacted sooner.   We thus have to ask: how we can do that? We need some kind of global disaster response plan.   And the World Health Organization must play a key part in this.   But first of all we have to ask ourselves what we expect from the World Health Organization, what we think it should achieve and what its member states have to provide.   In my opinion, the WHO is the only international organisation that enjoys universal political legitimacy on global health matters.   The aim now must therefore be to make its structures more efficient.   It is, I am sure, an advantage for the World Health Organization to have 150 country offices and six regional offices in addition to its headquarters  -  a decentralised structure with strong local links is important.   But lets be honest.   Decentralised structures can also impede decision-making and hinder good functioning.   Therefore the advantages of having a decentralised organisation must be harnessed in a way that links the three levels on which the WHO operates through clear hierarchies, so that ultimately everyone knows who has the say in any given situation, who has reporting obligations and who has to carry out the work.   This is, of course, easier said than done.   But I think that right now, when we are trying to learn lessons, it is important for everybody to make a special effort, to accept this challenge, and thus together to come up with something better.   Notwithstanding its central health policy legitimacy, the WHO cannot be the only organisation involved in drawing up a global disaster response plan.   We need to ensure that the WHO can work well together with the UN system as a whole and with the World Bank.   The Norwegian Prime Minister, the Ghanaian President and myself asked the Secretary-General of the United Nations to appoint a high-level panel to examine the interaction between these organisations more closely.   He has done so, and the panel has already started its work.   It is chaired by President Kikwete of Tanzania, and is due to submit a report by the end of the year, specifying what we have to learn with regard to international organisations, what contributions can be made by which organisations, and how we can in future be better prepared for health emergencies, as we are for natural disasters.   I am convinced that if we can respond more quickly, if we can act faster, if we have clear plans of action, then we will be able to fight a crisis such as the Ebola outbreak better next time.   But no matter how important international cooperation is, we must not lose sight of one thing.   The starting point must be that every country should develop or be in a position to develop its own health system, designed to ensure maximum resilience.   Building functioning health systems is a key task.   Germany is ready to tackle it.   This year and next year we will be providing affected countries with a total of 200 million euros.   Of this sum, 70 million euros will be earmarked for West Africa, to help build sustainable structures.   It should be seen as help towards self-help.   Ladies and gentlemen, the second item on our G7 agenda is neglected and poverty-related tropical diseases.   Their prevalence is linked to the fact that many countries are simply too poor to roll out their own health systems, which is why we have to help them do it.   About 1.  4 billion people are affected by what are known as ""neglected"" tropical diseases.   It is interesting to note that the suffering of hundreds of millions of people could be alleviated at relatively little material cost, in most cases at least.   To this end what we need is firstly robust health systems, the establishment of which is a long-term task, secondly the right products from the pharmaceutical industry, and thirdly, the logistics to distribute these products.   That is why it is very important to collaborate closely with the countries affected.   For example, logistical capabilities vary widely across the African continent.   We therefore not only have to develop health systems, but also appropriate administrative structures.   The third issue that Germany would like to address during its G7 Presidency is resistance to antibiotics.   We have obtained the advice of the National Academies of Sciences on this issue  -  and indeed on the subject of neglected tropical diseases.   I think this is an issue of crucial importance for the entire human race  -  for people in developed and less developed countries alike.   We must ensure that existing antibiotics remain effective, and that they are used only when medically necessary  -  not only when treating humans, but animals as well.   To this end we want to agree on the strictest standards possible at the G7 meeting, in particular for industrialised countries.   Antibiotics have to be used restrictively, because once pathogens have become resistant to them, it is much, much harder to develop new treatments  -  in contrast to the situation for example with neglected tropical diseases.   The pharmaceutical industry is an important partner in the fight against disease, but it can only provide new products through research and development.   I have been told how difficult it is to develop new varieties of antibiotics to replace the old ones.   We must therefore tread carefully if we are to make progress.   We must pursue a ""one health"" approach for both humans and animals.   I am delighted that the World Health Assembly has undertaken to draw up the first global action plan to address the problem of antimicrobial resistance.   Every country should have a plan of this sort.   Only a few days ago the German Cabinet adopted its own antimicrobial resistance strategy.   It will require close cooperation in the fields of human and veterinary medicine.   Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by thanking all the WHO staff, as well as the representatives of other UN organisations, NGOs and foundations.   The Ebola outbreak has once again highlighted the immense contribution made by NGOs and aid workers on the ground.   I would like to give special mention to the International Red Cross and the Red Crescent, and likewise Doctors Without Borders  -  and also to the many, many others, who have worked tirelessly together with the staff of international organisations.   I would thus like to close my statement with an appeal  -  one which we will also make at the G7 Summit.   Every single person is vitally needed to fight for the human right to health.   The framework has changed over the past years.   When the World Health Organization was established, it was the only organisation in the field.   But now it shares the stage with various foundations and highly competent NGOs.   Everyone who is working towards the same goal is equally important.   Let us work together in a spirit of cooperation, and not seek to undermine each others deeds.   The task is so immense and the endeavour so important that every helping hand is needed.   Therefore may I say a final sincere thank you for your efforts to help humankind.   During its G7 Presidency, Germany and the other G7 countries will endeavour to support and advance your work.   Thank you very much.","Statement by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the 68th session of the WHO World Health Assembly",2015-05-21,"Germany","A.Merkel",1735,"en"
"3","doc73861","in Berlin Mr President, my dear François, Minister Fabius, Minister Hendricks, Ministers, Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy that I can be here with you and the French President at this years Petersberg Climate Dialogue.   This is a very special event, which definitely whets our appetite for the annual climate conference and makes clear what needs to be done.   That is particularly important this year, as one aim of the 2015 Petersberg Climate Dialogue is to play a part in ensuring that France can hold a successful climate conference this year.   Germany and France want to work closely together at both the ministerial and heads of government level to make the conference in Paris a success.   The aim is to achieve a binding climate agreement in Paris  -  no more and no less.   Everyone who is familiar with the topic knows what that means.   There is no doubt that the word ""binding"" is ambitious.   But this is what must be achieved.   It is no exaggeration to say that we have been working towards the goal of a binding climate agreement for a very long time indeed.   I launched the Petersberg Climate Dialogue in 2010 after the outcome of the Conference of the Parties in Copenhagen in 2009 fell short of expectations.   In the meantime, it has become a good tradition to spend several days working with representatives of many countries in a pleasant working environment.   At the time, our aim was to lend new impetus to the climate debate.   I believe that we have largely achieved this.   As early as 2011, the members of the UN Climate Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed in Durban to draw up a binding agreement for all States Parties by 2015.   This agreement is due to enter into force by 2020 at the latest.   It is now 2015, and the final spurt lies ahead of us.   Behind us lie four years of many small and large steps  -  but if I may say so, steps in the right direction.   One example is international climate financing.   Over $10 billion has been pledged for the initial capitalisation of the Green Climate Fund.   The first projects are due to be selected, and ideally also launched, before the conference in Paris.   However, I would like to add that this is also urgently needed, as many countries that need funding are constantly hearing about huge sums, but when you ask what funding has actually arrived, you hear that the implementation still leaves a lot to be desired.   That is why it is important, particularly as regards building confidence, that the first projects be selected without delay.   Pioneering programmes have been created and further developed to protect forests and ensure they are used in a climate-friendly way.   The global partnership REDD+ is an excellent example of this.   It provides funding for measures to protect rain and moist forests in developing countries, with a focus on results.   Voluntary initiatives such as the cities alliance Compact of Mayors, in which over 2,000 cities have signed up to ambitious goals and measures, also show us how climate protection can be put into practice locally.   And last but not least, wind and solar farm costs have decreased dramatically worldwide, while competitiveness has increased significantly.   All countries can make use of the enormous potential.   These are all encouraging examples that show us we can make Paris a success.   The big question is how to achieve the great transformation to an emissions-free development in the long term and how to reach an agreement that creates a launching pad for this development.   The agreement must forge a framework for our future actions.   We need an agenda for the next steps.   Our guideline remains  -  and must remain  -  the 2°C target.   We agreed on this limit for global warming at the climate conference in Cancún.   And we need to adhere to it in order to at least mitigate the worst effects of climate change.   The first step involves concrete reduction targets.   All countries are to announce their national contributions to the new agreement as soon as possible before the conference in Paris.   In other words, we are now in the crucial phase.   So far, around 40 States Parties have done so.   Germany is supporting a large number of nations in this work, that is, around 30 countries in different parts of the world.   The European Union already sent a clear political signal last autumn.   The Member States agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 per cent compared to 1990 levels, to raise the share of renewable energies to at least 27 per cent of total energy consumption, and to increase energy efficiency by at least 27 per cent compared to the reference figure, all by 2030.   These targets form the basis for the European Unions contribution to the international climate protection agreement.   In any case, the words ""at least"" keep the door open to considering in the light of the international negotiations whether we can also go beyond the EUs internal targets, for example by using international emissions allowances.   Here in Germany, our aim is to reduce emissions by 40 per cent compared to 1990 levels by as soon as 2020.   Our reduction road map sets a target of as much as 80 to 95 per cent by 2050.   In order to actually achieve our aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by 2020, the German Government approved an action programme last year.   The idea is to undertake additional measures and reach concrete reduction targets in the transport, buildings, electricity generation, industry, waste and agriculture sectors.   We are currently working at full speed on implementing this programme, as we have not yet quite reached our goal.   We constantly need to find ways to combine economic productivity with ambitious climate targets.   And this means we also have a problem, which we in the European Union need to discuss: the more integrated our electricity market becomes and the more our grids are interconnected, the more difficult it will become to set national targets, as there will be a great deal of power exchange in the electricity sector.   However, so far we are adhering to our national targets.   We want to combine climate protection with growth.   We also feel it is our duty in the European Union to play our part in creating worldwide innovations.   After all, we, the industrialised countries, caused much of global warming for many years, and it is now our duty to show those still awaiting development more efficient technologies by creating innovations.   This is an act of justice and reflects the differentiated responsibilities we have in this shared world of ours.   Ladies and gentlemen, we must not lose sight of the goal.   We can already tell that Paris will show us how we will need even more commitment than we have today in order to achieve the 2°C target.   We need a long-term vision to guide us, but also to spur us on, so we do not lose sight of the goal.   Scientists have provided clear guidelines on what needs to be done.   We must achieve decarbonisation this century, that is, we must make the transition to a carbon-free economy in the 21st century.   Germany and France share this vision and also advocate it together to our partners.   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calls for greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by 40 to 70 per cent by 2050 compared to 2010 levels as a medium-term goal on the path to decarbonisation.   We now need a concrete target to guide us clearly on this path.   With a view to the conference in Paris, we are advocating a reduction of at least 60 per cent compared to 2010 levels as a long-term global target.   This would equate to a global reduction of at least 50 per cent compared to 1990 levels.   There is no doubt this is highly ambitious.   However, it could be achieved if we join forces.   We also need a mechanism that allows us to verify whether our measures are really enough to limit global warming to a maximum of 2°C.   This is why it will be very important to agree on this mechanism as precisely as possible.   It will be crucial that we steer investments in a climate-friendly direction worldwide  -  this does not mean foregoing growth, but rather generating it differently to the way we have so far.   In its study, ""Better Growth, Better Climate"", the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate made it clear that the next 15 years will be critical for this.   This aim is supported by truly renowned individuals from the worlds of business, science and politics who have joined forces under the chairmanship of the former President of Mexico, Felipe Calderón.   They believe that the global economy will grow by more than half in the next 15 years and expect the worlds urban population to increase by a billion people.   They predict rapid technological advances, which will further change our lives.   This transformation will be accompanied by high investments in infrastructure, energy systems, urban development and land use.   The report talks about investments of $90 trillion.   If we succeed in directing these new investments to low-emission projects, this will safeguard both prosperity and climate protection.   These two things can go hand in hand.   It is now a matter of setting incentives in the right way.   We believe that carbon pricing, for example through emissions trading, is a way forward.   Last year, the World Bank launched the initiative, Putting a Price on Carbon, which it is continuing to develop.   It is thus promoting greater cooperation between governments, companies and other actors in order to bring about suitable measures.   Carbon pricing has already been introduced in 40 countries and over 20 sub-national legal systems.   This covers 22 per cent of global emissions.   Further countries will follow.   For example, China has announced the introduction of a national emissions trading system in 2016, which will surpass the European Unions system, the largest in the world so far.   We have already gained some experience of emissions trading in the European Union.   We have seen that reforms are now urgently needed.   On the one hand, we have seen that low economic growth in the past years has led to high surpluses of certificates.   On the other hand, a large number of allowances has been generated by international projects.   These two things have brought about a drop in certificate prices, which is why we are now setting up a market stability reserve and withholding certificates from the market.   This will prevent severe fluctuations in amounts and prices, thus providing greater planning certainty.   I am very pleased that this market stability reserve will come into effect before 2020.   The next step will be to adapt the EU Emissions Trading System Directive to the new target of reducing greenhouse gases by 40 per cent.   In doing so, we must take care that the competitiveness of Europes economy is not compromised.   Of course, the more non-EU countries that have an emissions trading system, the easier it will be for us in the European Union, as competition conditions will become more similar once again.   Our aim must be to have a global carbon market with a robust and reliable CO2 price signal.   Then we could set incentives worldwide for achieving our climate targets in a cost-effective way.   We could also tap into additional sources of financing to fund climate protection measures.   This brings me to a crucial point, which will have a major impact as regards making the conference in Paris a success or a failure, that is, international climate financing.   Developing countries must also follow a climate-friendly path.   However, they need our financial support to do so.   They also need this support in order to be able to adapt and react to current climate change in the first place.   These are challenges that the developing countries cannot overcome on their own.   I recall the negotiations in Copenhagen very clearly.   We did not manage to agree on everything there, but we did agree that $100 billion should be raised from public and private sector sources every year from 2020 to help developing countries.   Germany stands to this pledge.   We will take on our fair share.   Since 2005, we have quadrupled climate financing from our budget to a total of around €2 billion in 2013.   On top of this, KfW Group has provided €1.  5 billion in loans for climate protection and adaptation measures in developing countries.   We have allocated increased funding in our financial planning up to 2019.   As a result, we will be able to increase our spending on development aid by a total of €8.  3 billion between 2016 and 2019.   And for this reason, I can now say that Germany aims to double its international climate financing by 2020 compared to 2014 figures.   We know that industrialised countries will have to provide more funding if we are to adhere to the pledges of $100 billion from 2020.   According to the World Bank, only around a third of the pledged funding has been raised so far.   There is a shortfall of some $70 billion.   As regards reaching an agreement that finds general consensus, this means it will be very important to draw up a clear road map to breach this gap.   Doing so depends both on public sector pledges and private sector investors.   In turn, this means that attractive investment conditions must be created.   This will involve tackling a wide range of issues  -  the legal and political parameters, the choice of investment projects and financing costs.   To this end, we certainly also need new financing instruments, which should keep the concrete financing risks in the relevant developing countries at an acceptable level.   There is no doubt that the industrialised countries must take the lead here.   As Germany currently holds the Presidency of the G7, I hope that we will be able to send an ambitious signal before the Summit Meeting of Heads of State and Government in Elmau.   However, we still have a little way to go.   I am very happy that newly industrialising countries are also increasingly taking on their international responsibility.   Countries such as Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, Panama, Peru and the Republic of Korea are contributing funding to the Green Climate Funds initial target, thus underlining their willingness to take on a share of global responsibility beyond their national borders.   International climate financing must increasingly focus on the poorest countries, which are often the nations most adversely affected by climate change.   On the other hand, newly industrialising countries are more likely to be able to fund the necessary investments on their own.   The investment climate for environmentally friendly technologies has improved significantly in many of these countries.   I would like to mention just one example.   In the meantime, developing and newly industrialising countries have reached almost the same volume of investments in renewable energies as industrialised countries.   China, India and Brazil are outstanding examples of this.   In fact, some of these countries are using innovative instruments on a grand scale  -  instruments that are still in the testing phase in industrialised countries.   South Africa, which has had good experiences with tendering renewable energy capacities, is a notable example.   Germany is currently only trying this out on a small scale.   In other words, when it comes to introducing and expanding new technologies  -  be they renewable energies, electromobility or other technologies  -  many countries are facing very similar challenges as regards the environment and the economy.   This is why target-focused partnerships will make even more sense in the future than has been the case so far.   Ladies and gentlemen, the challenge of climate protection is easier for all of us when we can trust that our partners in the world are pursuing the same goal.   This is one of the reasons why we need a comprehensive agreement that shows us how we can adhere to the 2°C target, sets fair and binding regulations for industrialised and developing countries, provides incentives for investments in low-emission development all over the world while making adjustment and risk management properly into account in the poorest countries, and above all provides poorer countries with financing support and offers incentives for low-emission development via carbon pricing and markets.   This simply means that the people on this planet can hope that climate protection and individual prosperity can be achieved in equal measure, even if we have to take new paths to do so.   I am happy to be able to be here today and would like to assure French President François Hollande that Germany will stand shoulder to shoulder with France to do everything it can to ensure the conference is a success.   But without you and, even more so, those who are not here today, this will hardly be possible.   We can only reach an agreement for our shared world if we work together.   And that should be our goal.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Sixth Petersberg Climate Dialogue",2015-05-21,"Germany","A.Merkel",2774,"en"
"4","doc73841","nat the Federal Chancellery in Berlin Nuncio, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, State Secretary Steinlein, representing the Federal Foreign Office, Mr Altmaier, Head of the Federal Chancellery, Federal Chancellery staff, I would like to welcome you all most warmly to the Federal Chancellery.   I have to admit that this is the second year we havent been able to go to Meseberg, because it has been raining hard again, as it has in Berlin, and a garden party isnt the best idea in this weather.   But we wont give up hope.   Well have to see what happens next year.   Nonetheless, we can still gather at the Federal Chancellery to talk about the political climate.   At the G7 summit in Elmau one month ago we debated current issues concerning the global economy and foreign policy.   I would like to thank all those who attended.   We had very intensive discussions not only in the G7 format but also with representatives of the outreach states, particularly on the subjects of counter-terrorism and the fight against Ebola as well as global health.   We in the G7 share common values - human rights, respect for the dignity of every individual, freedom, democracy, the rule of law and territorial integrity.   Our agenda for action derives from these values.   We want to create areas of freedom, areas of justice, areas of free trade with high environmental and social standards.   In the G7 we discussed how we can all move nearer to these goals with leaders of international organisations as well as with our guests, as I already mentioned.   You are all aware of the great challenges we face.   We live in a rapidly changing world.   The global population is growing, but resources are limited.   The question of how to ensure development opportunities for all is therefore becoming increasingly urgent.   The answer, of course, lies in global economic growth that embraces preservation of the natural foundations of life as well as social responsibility.   I am very glad that the G7 Summit also sparked ideas on this issue in particular.   Yet it is of course clear that in the G7 there are far too few of us to make any great impact.   We need many supporters outside the G7 to get involved.   For example, we can only embark on decarbonisation of the global economy if we all regard it as a joint task.   The UN Climate Change Conference in Paris at the end of this year has to lay the groundwork for this.   What happens there will show whether and to what extent the international community is willing and able to embrace the responsibility it has particularly towards future generations.   I support UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Frances President Hollande in their efforts to ensure that important progress on climate protection can finally be made in Paris.   The impact of climate change is particularly evident in southern countries, where it is restricting development opportunities considerably.   It therefore makes sense for the new post-2015 agenda to combine the issues of sustainability and development.   Germany is lobbying for ambitious goals in this area.   Today the International Conference on Financing for Development, where Federal Minister Gerd Müller is representing Germany, has begun in Addis Ababa.   To achieve the new development goals, all forms of financing are necessary - both public and private investment.   All countries are called upon to do whatever they can to help achieve these goals, according to their capacity.   This also makes economic sense, for we are experiencing on a daily basis that in the tide of globalisation the fates of the individual economic regions are closely linked.   We as the international community have a unique opportunity to create the conditions for eliminating absolute poverty within one generation  -  that means by 2030  -  with an ambitious post-2015 agenda.   And let me say that Germany recognises its obligation to do its part in order to ensure that we do indeed achieve this goal.   Peace is and remains a crucial requirement for development.   Yet we are currently seeing a large number of conflicts, not to mention the human tragedies, that are setting entire regions back many years.   Islamist terrorist militias are sweeping through Syria and Iraq in a trail of terrible violence.   They are terrorising people wherever they manage to gain a foothold.   The fact that in addition they are mindlessly destroying cultural property shows once again their ignorance and lack of respect for humanitys great historical achievements.   Extremism and terrorism are threatening peace in other parts of the world, too.   To counteract this we have to dry up support for extremism and terrorism.   That means we have to back those who take an active stand against the ideology of intolerance and hatred.   That means that in countries such as Syria and Iraq we have to support a political process that gives an equal voice to all population groups.   That means that here in Europe we have to ensure that young people do not fall victim to radical ideologies.   We sense that the evil of terrorism affects us all.   Even in Europe far too many young people are being lured into joining terrorist groups.   In Europe, too, terrorists are wreaking havoc.   Attacks like those in Paris in January target the essence of peaceful and tolerant co-existence.   They are attacks against humanity.   We can also see the consequences of terrorism, war and the resulting loss of perspective, which find one expression in the large numbers of refugees.   The refugee agency UNHCR reports almost 60 million refugees, displaced persons and asylum seekers worldwide  -  more than at any time since the Second World War.   We know that in Europe we can only overcome this challenge through cooperation and solidarity.   To this end we have formulated a comprehensive strategy which focuses on several areas simultaneously.   Taking in the refugees requires more than the engagement of just a few EU countries; we really need commitment from the whole of Europe.   We have already taken a decision on improving sea rescue operations.   The refugee tragedies in the Mediterranean have to come to an end.   We also have to put a stop to the evil and criminal activities of the human traffickers, who are only interested in unscrupulously exploiting the plight of helpless and vulnerable people.   Above all we need to tackle the problems leading to flight and displacement.   This requires better cooperation with the countries of origin and transit.   This presents us with significant challenges, especially with regard to Libya.   Armed conflicts are hampering the countrys progress towards political stability.   We in Germany and in the European Union could support a government of national unity, such as Mr Léon is trying to establish, with the entire range of tools at our disposal.   In Tunisia we have seen that progress leading to a stable democratic constitution is possible if influential political and social players demonstrate a willingness to compromise and reach a consensus.   Yet we also see that this success is built on shaky foundations, as the murders in the Bardo museum and on the beach at Sousse have all too painfully shown.   We stand by Tunisia at this time.   We have promised to intensify our cooperation in the fight against terrorism and in the area of border security.   North Africa as a whole will continue to be a focus of German and European foreign policy.   We want good cooperation with our neighbours.   That goes for those in the south, but of course it also applies to those to the east.   We continue to consider Russias annexation of Crimea in violation of international law.   We are aware of the destabilising influences in eastern Ukraine.   Russias action violates key principles of the peaceful order in Europe.   That is why the sanctions adopted by the European Union continue to apply.   However, we want to see a political solution.   Germany and France, above all the French President, are striving to achieve this.   We want to implement the Minsk agreements, for we know that otherwise a political process will prove very difficult.   We want Ukraine to be able to re-assume responsibility for shaping its own future.   Ukraine can count on international support in this endeavour.   Yet we do not want it to have to choose between moving closer to the European Union and forging good relations with Russia.   In our view, both should be possible.   Last week I visited Albania, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.   The violent conflicts in the 1990s have left deep scars in those countries, particularly in their relations with one another.   That is why I am very glad that the conference on the Western Balkans held in Berlin in 2014 sparked a range of ideas, for a youth exchange programme and for regional transport projects, among others, as I was told several times during my trip to the Balkans.   It is also a good sign that the prime ministers of all the countries of the Western Balkans have already met three times outside the framework of such a conference to discuss concerns on their common agenda.   The concrete results that have been achieved since last year are to be presented at the follow-up conference in Vienna.   The fact that we will have concrete results to present is good news.   We know, as we saw once again on the occasion of the 20 th anniversary in Srebrenica, that it is no easy task to reach out a hand to one another after the suffering of the past.   But we in Europe, in the European Union, have learned from experience that there is no division between neighbours that is so deep and so wide that it cannot be overcome.   Seventy years ago the Shoah, that betrayal by Germany of all civilised values, and the Second World War came to an end.   Germany had brought immeasurable suffering on Europe and the world.   By the end our country was in ruins  -  both materially and, even worse, morally.   In view of this history, the reconciliation with our neighbours, which engendered understanding, partnership and ultimately friendship, still seems like a miracle  -  especially the unique relationship between Germany and Israel, on which we are focusing this year as we celebrate the 50 th anniversary of the commencement of diplomatic relations.   We have our partners and friends in Europe and the United States of America to thank for the integration of our country in the international community.   Sixty years ago the Federal Republic of Germany was able to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   NATO remains the anchor of our common security to this day.   Allow me at this point to mention the tragic sudden death of Philipp Mißfelder today.   We are all shocked.   Many of you knew him as our Foreign Affairs Spokesman.   Our thoughts are with his wife and two small children at this time.   We will miss him greatly.   Ladies and gentlemen, this year we Germans are celebrating another anniversary: the achievement of German unification 25 years ago.   It would not have been possible if our partners in the world had not had confidence in us and confidence in the Chancellor at that time, Helmut Kohl.   The end of the division of Germany went hand in hand with the end of the division of Europe.   East and West were reunited.   I am looking forward to celebrating this happy moment in our history in the autumn.   In the past 25 years, in this quarter of a century, we have achieved a great deal.   Germany has developed in a way that hardly anyone could have predicted.   Yet the united Europe as a whole has made huge progress in the past 25 years.   Our cooperation has a whole new quality thanks to the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of Lisbon, for example, and of course, last but not least, our monetary union.   The decision to adopt the euro reflects the idea of European integration like no other.   Our goal is and remains for Europe to emerge from the European public debt crisis stronger than when it went into it.   To this end we have undertaken a range of necessary measures, improved stability regulations, set up aid programmes and implemented reforms.   Ireland, Spain and Portugal have been through a tough process, but they have been able to complete their aid programmes successfully.   They have gained stability.   In recent days all eyes have been on Greece.   Last night the finance ministers of the Eurogroup as well as the Heads of State and Government were able to prepare the ground and create the conditions for opening negotiations on an ESM programme for Greece.   Before the German Bundestag can make a decision on this, we have of course to await the outcome of the deliberations in the Greek Parliament tomorrow and the day after.   If the outcome is successful, we will ask the German Bundestag to give the Federal Government a negotiating mandate for an ESM programme of this nature.   Ladies and gentlemen, despite all the challenges we keep encountering, we should not lose sight of how precious the idea of European integration is.   More than 500 million people live in a community of law founded on shared responsibility  -  in a community of shared values based on freedom, democracy and the rule of law.   We benefit from this every day.   We should keep this in mind, even though our discussions are sometimes heated.   Diversity of opinion is, like the ability to compromise, one of Europes great strengths.   In Europe, as in all other regions of the world, we generally do better when we talk to one another instead of talking about or past one another.   You as ambassadors are not only representatives of your countries.   You also build bridges between our countries.   You work to foster cooperation and help improve mutual understanding.   In view of the many problems in the world, only a few of which I have been able to mention, your role as bridge-builders and door-openers is more important now than ever before.   So please regard this reception as a special form of thanks to each and every one of you, along with heartfelt greetings to each of your home countries.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Reception for the Diplomatic Corps",2015-07-16,"Germany","A.Merkel",2348,"en"
"5","doc73831","in New York Mr President, Ladies and gentlemen, In just a few days time, we in Germany will be celebrating 25 years of German unity.   In Europe we will be celebrating the end of the Cold War.   What had been a divided Europe grew together in peace and freedom.   Many had dreamt of this for decades, but hardly anyone believed it possible.   Today, though, we know this: nothing has to remain as it is.   Change, change for the better, is possible.   And we also know that every great plan has its seed in the mind.   Today we are united here in our goal of eradicating absolute poverty by 2030  -  another goal which not all that long ago was too often dismissed as a pipedream.   But now, 15 years on from the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals, it is clear that we can in fact manage to achieve it.   We have already come half way.   Absolute poverty has been halved.   This gives us every reason to believe that we will manage the next stage too.   We want to change our world.   And we can.   We want to give the world a more humane face.   And we can.   That is what the 2030 Agenda is for.   To this end, we are adopting new goals which cover the entire spectrum of global development and which apply to all, industrial and developing countries alike.   If we are to achieve these goals, we need a new global partnership.   In order to establish such a global partnership, we need, firstly, efficient structures at all levels  -  national, regional and global.   That is why we in Germany will further develop our National Sustainability Strategy in the light of the 2030 Agenda.   As early as 2016, Germany will be one of the first states to report on implementation in the High-level Political Forum.   Germany also supports regional organisations and partnerships which allow efforts to be combined.   Furthermore, we are committed to strong global structures enabling us to master challenges which would overwhelm individual states.   The Ebola epidemic in West Africa was one such challenge.   It was a bitter warning which made it abundantly clear that good interaction among all stakeholders, with a reformed World Health Organization at the centre, is absolutely crucial.   Together with Ghana and Norway, we asked the Secretary-General of the United Nations to set up a High-level Panel to identify the correct lessons from this epidemic and to ensure that the world will be able to respond faster and more effectively in future.   Seventy years after its foundation, the United Nations as a whole, with its unique legitimacy, is still indispensable when it comes to resolving the issues facing humanity.   But it, too, needs to adapt to new challenges.   Germany will play an active part in the necessary reform process.   Secondly, a global partnership needs the necessary financial resources.   Viable structures will enable us to make efficient use of these resources.   The Financing for Development Conference in Addis Ababa in July showed how such resources can be mobilised.   Germany stands by the obligation to use 0.  7 percent of its GDP for development assistance.   Our development assistance budget will increase substantially in each of the next few years.   State support is important, but it can only be one aspect: private investment, too, is crucial for the development of our states.   Mobilising such investment must be a focus of our policy.   In Paris at the end of the year, we want to adopt an ambitious climate agreement which obliges all states to do more for climate protection.   This agreement would fix the framework for a sustainable development path to keep global warming below two degrees.   For this we need a shared vision of how to attain decarbonisation at global level before the end of this century.   Here, too, the right investment is necessary.   It is important  -  and Germany will do its part  -  that the industrialised countries stick to the pledge they made in Copenhagen and make 100 billion dollars a year available to the developing countries for climate protection from 2020.   In this way, we will create the confidence that all countries in the world can develop in a climate-friendly manner and that particularly vulnerable countries can receive help to adapt to climate change.   The key prerequisite for successful development is and will remain peace.   But millions of people  -  more than at any time since the Second World War  -  are being forced to flee war, terror and violence.   Their suffering is exacerbated by their lack of prospects for the future and by the destruction of their environment.   Anyone who witnesses the suffering of those who have left their homes to seek protection and a future elsewhere, and who is aware of the challenge facing the countries which take in the refugees, knows that in the end there can be but one solution: we must tackle the causes of flight and expulsion.   The 2030 Agenda provides the right framework for this.   It balances economic, ecological and social aspects of development.   Each and every one of us should, indeed must, work to implement this Agenda  -  so that people the world over can live a life in dignity.   This must be our shared aspiration.   By agreeing on the Agenda we are setting the course for efforts to tackle the causes.   The priority now is to work towards this end at all levels  -  national, regional and global.   Germany will do so.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Dr Angela Merkel, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit",2015-09-28,"Germany","A.Merkel",894,"en"
"6","doc73821","in Strasbourg President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, Distinguished colleagues at the European Parliament, Ladies and gentlemen, The last time a French President and a German Chancellor jointly addressed the European Parliament was in November 1989.   François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl spoke together here in Strasbourg shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall.   Both of them felt that great changes were about to sweep Germany and Europe.   Both of them were deeply moved by this wind of change.   Both of them clearly expressed their commitment to responding with joint European solutions.   And so the healing of the divide in Germany was ultimately followed by the healing of divisions in Europe.   Today we can look back with gratitude and some pride on the historic achievements that we Europeans were responsible for over these years of continental bonding.   And now it seems a matter of course to us that Europe is free and united.   But this historic achievement required tremendous exertions.   The old member states were, for example, visited by fears and scepticism regarding the plans to almost double the number of European Union member states.   Many people viewed freedom of movement for millions of new EU citizens as a threat to their own jobs.   New decision-making structures had to be created.   European funds had to be redirected towards the new member states.   Today we can see that these efforts have paid off for us all.   They have not brought us less prosperity, but more prosperity.   They have not brought us less freedom, but more freedom.   They have not brought us less diversity, but more diversity.   In brief, they have brought us more Europe, because we Europeans have learned in the course of our history to make the most of our diversity.   The quality that has enabled us to do this, that has allowed us to combine freedom with responsibility, is tolerance.   This is a precious asset.   Overcoming the fault-lines between East and West has proven to be a massive success story.   It has shown us what we Europeans can do if we only want to, if we are bold and stick together.   It has also shown that there is no reason at all to be discouraged by the set-backs that are bound to come every now and again.   In a nutshell, it has shown us what is possible.   This has also been shown by the drafting of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Lisbon Treaty.   This has been shown by the lessons of the international financial crisis, which we mastered together and from which we emerged stronger than we had entered it.   This has been shown by the European debt crisis, during which we acted together.   François Hollande mentioned the difficult negotiations.   But by acting together we were able to preserve the cohesion of the eurozone.   Ladies and gentlemen, today the French President François Hollande and myself have been given the privilege of addressing you.   I would like to thank the President of the European Parliament for this kind invitation.   Now, again, Europe is facing a tremendous challenge.   We are facing a test of historic proportions.   I am talking of course about the many, many people who have set off on dangerous journeys to Europe to seek refuge here.   People who are crossing the Mediterranean to reach Italy, or who are crossing the Aegean from Turkey to Greece.   People who are fleeing civil wars, especially the war in Syria, which has already claimed more than 250,000 lives and made refugees of more than 10 million individuals.   Refugees from Iraq and refugees from Africa who cross the unstable state of Libya to reach us.   They all know too well that our diplomatic and political efforts and those of our transatlantic allies have not yet brought peace in Syria.   It proved impossible to prevent the terrorist organisation IS from gaining strength in Iraq and in Syria.   The power vacuum in Libya has not yet been filled.   Giving these people the chance to live their lives in dignity, in their home countries, without being scared to death by bombs and terrorists  -  managing that is a European task, and ultimately a global task.   Todays message is that it will take a determined contribution from Europe to solve this crisis  -  by taking action against war and displacement, terrorism and political persecution, and against poverty and despair.   Germany and France have endeavoured resolutely to resolve the terrible conflict between Russia and Ukraine.   We have seen the Crimea annexed, and eastern Ukraine destabilised.   To be quite frank, it is fortunate that we in Europe acted together, that we imposed sanctions together and said that Russias actions constituted an impermissible violation of our principles.   We are now working in the ""Normandy"" format to resolve this conflict.   Just last Friday we held talks in France, in Paris, which give us cause to hope that at least the ceasefire could hold.   The elections in Donetsk and Luhansk have indeed been postponed.   But, ladies and gentlemen, this is only one of many conflicts.   Im convinced that we have to tailor our foreign and development policy far more closely to the goals of resolving conflicts and combating the factors that cause people to flee their homes.   We will also have to provide much more money than we have done to date.   The necessary decisions to this end will have to be taken quickly.   All of these things will change Europe again, just as Europe was profoundly altered by the revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe 25 years ago.   Of course we will continue to work on improving our competitiveness.   Of course we will work on the digitisation of our societies, on sustainable development, on a joint energy policy and on free trade agreements with other countries in line with our principles.   Now more than ever, there is a need for an economically strong Europe, which uses the opportunities of the single market.   To this end we have to improve economic policy coordination within the eurozone and, on that basis, correct the mistakes that were made when the European economic and monetary union was created.   Germany and France will play their part in this endeavour.   But the truly massive number of refugees is changing Europes agenda in yet another way  -  and permanently, because they challenge our values and interests as Europeans and worldwide in a unique way.   If the aim is to regulate and ultimately curb the flood of refugees, there is no alternative to addressing the issues which cause people to flee their homes.   This will obviously require time, patience and a long-term strategy.   In these past few months in particular, we in Europe have seen how closely connected we are to these global events, directly, whether we like it or not.   We can no longer shut ourselves off from what is happening in the world.   Not since the Second World War have so many people fled their homes as today  -  the number has now reached around 60 million.   This figure alone highlights the dimension of the task.   Nobody leaves their home lightly  -  not even those who are coming to Europe for economic reasons.   But we have to say to these people that they cannot stay, to make sure that we can truly help those who genuinely need our protection from war and persecution.   We need a political process involving all regional and international actors to resolve the crisis in Syria  -  with a greater role for Europe.   We have to help Syrias neighbours so that they can offer the millions of refugees decent prospects.   The European Commission has thus put forward proposals on an improved financial framework.   I would also like to thank the European Parliament for supporting these proposals.   The national states must also play their part.   Turkey has a key role to play.   It is our direct neighbour and a gateway for irregular migration.   Turkey is doing amazing things for more than two million refugees from Syria.   But it needs more support from us  -  to feed and accommodate the refugees, to secure borders, and to fight human traffickers.   For this very reason, the dialogue on migration policy that the European Commission has launched with Turkey is of vital importance.   Germany will work bilaterally in support of the Commissions endeavours in this regard.   Equally important are the efforts to form a government of national unity in Libya.   Europe supports the efforts undertaken by UN Envoy León.   The entire European Union is called upon to address these challenges.   In the refugee crisis we must not give in to the temptation to fall back on national government action.   On the contrary, what we need now is more Europe.   More than ever we need the courage and cohesion that Europe has always shown when it was really important.   Germany and France are ready to act accordingly.   We are in full agreement on this with the President of the European Commission, who has put many important proposals on the table, proposals that we now need to implement systematically.   We are in full agreement on this with the President of the European Council, who is working tirelessly to improve cooperation with the countries of origin and transit.   And we are in full agreement on this with the European Parliament, which in its resolution of 10 September reminded us that national go-it-alone efforts will not solve the refugee crisis.   Mr President, we would also like to thank you for adopting unconventional, fast-track decisions.   These were important.   For only together will Europe succeed in mitigating the root causes of flight and displacement worldwide.   Only together will we succeed in effectively combating criminal human trafficking rings.   Only together will we succeed in better protecting the external borders of the European Union with jointly operated hotspots and manage not to jeopardise our internally border-less Europe.    -  I will say it explicitly: we will only be able to successfully protect our external borders if we do something in our neighbourhood to overcome the many crises that are happening on our doorstep, as it were.    -  Only together will we succeed in concluding EU-wide returns agreements, in order to get those people who will not be allowed to stay here back to their countries of origin.   Only together will we succeed in distributing the refugees fairly and equitably among all the member states.   A first step has been taken.   For this too I would like to thank the Parliament, or rather a majority thereof.   Lets be honest, the Dublin procedure in its current form is obsolete in practice.   The intention behind it was good, of that there can be no doubt.   But, all in all, it has not proven viable when faced with the current challenges at our external borders.   I therefore advocate the adoption of a new approach based on fairness and solidarity in sharing the burdens.   I welcome the Commissions work in this regard.   I think it is good that Germany and France are in agreement on this point.   Equally, it is only together that we will succeed in tackling the huge job of integrating so many refugees.   We can rightly expect the people who come to us in Europe to become integrated into our societies.   This requires them to uphold the rules that apply here, and to learn the language of their new homeland.   But, conversely, we also have a duty to treat the people who come to us in need with respect, to see them as human beings and not as an anonymous mass  -  regardless of whether they will be allowed to stay or not.   That is why it is so important to uphold the minimum humanitarian standards we agreed on for feeding and housing refugees and for conducting asylum proceedings.   We owe that to them, the refugees, and to ourselves.   For Europe is a community of shared values, a community founded on shared rules and shared responsibility.   In my opinion this means that we must be guided by the values we have enshrined in the European treaties: human dignity, the rule of law, tolerance, respect for minorities and solidarity.   In my opinion it means that pan-European challenges are not to be solved by a few member states on their own, but by all of us together.   We need to realise that it wouldnt help anybody for us to try to completely isolate ourselves, to knowingly allow for the fact that people could come to harm at our borders  -  certainly not the people concerned, who would still find ways and means of getting here, and not even ourselves in Europe.   Retreating from the world and shutting ourselves off is an illusion in the age of the Internet.   It would not solve any problems, but would create additional ones, for we would be abandoning our values and thereby losing our identity.   If we forget that, we betray ourselves  -  its that simple.   But if we remember it, we will manage to pass this historic test and will, moreover, emerge stronger from this crisis than we went into it.   Then we will manage to persuasively stand up for our values and interests at global level, too.   By the way, that is what people outside of Europe, too, expect of us.   Ladies and gentlemen, the reasons why people leave their homelands are all too familiar to us from our own European history.   For centuries, our continent was not the destination, but first and foremost the starting point for refugees, displaced persons and migrants.    -  Jean-Claude Juncker reminded us forcefully of this fact in his state of the Union address.    -  Today Europe is a region on which many people from all over the world pin their hopes and aspirations  -  a region that people dream of, in the way that, 25 years ago, I and millions of others in Central and Eastern Europe dreamed of a free and united Germany and Europe.   We have to deal responsibly with Europes gravitational pull.   In other words, we have to take greater care of those who are in need today in our neighbourhood.   If we view this challenge as a joint European and worldwide challenge, we will also be able to identify and seize the economic and social opportunities that this historic test brings.   And we will, incidentally, see that the opportunities are greater than the risks.   We will have to continue working hard to convince people of the value of our Europe.   François Hollande, after centuries of war and hatred between our two peoples we are today fighting together for shared objectives.   I would like to invite all of you here in this distinguished House to work together to convince people of the value of our Europe.   Every single MEP can play an important role  -  in your home states, in your constituencies, and across Europe vis-à-vis the pan-European public.   Let us work together on this, in the manner that Helmut Kohl suggested back in 1989 here in the European Parliament with an eye on the revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe.   I quote: ""with judiciousness and moderation, with creativity and flexibility"".   Thank you very much.","Statement by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to the European Parliament",2015-10-14,"Germany","A.Merkel",2516,"en"
"7","doc73811","in Paris Mr President, my dear friend François Hollande, Secretary-General, Colleagues, We are meeting here in Paris in turbulent and worrying times.   Only a few days ago, not far from this venue, terrorists launched an attack on the people of Paris, and by extension on us all.   We condemn terrorism  -  wherever it strikes.   By coming here today we are demonstrating that we are stronger than any terrorists.   Today, heads of government from some 150 countries have the chance to look beyond all the controversies and differing interests, and to send a very clear joint message  -  a message that will determine the future of our planet.   At stake are the foundations on which the life of future generations will depend.   We are well aware of the need to act today.   That is what this Conference is all about.   That is the defining feature of the outcome we will have to agree on in the next few days.   I would like to start off by thanking everyone involved in preparing this meeting, in particular the French Government and the United Nations.   After a long hiatus, we now have the chance to reach our goal  -  an international agreement.   Put simply, this means no more and no less than ensuring that the rise in global temperatures remains under 2°C in comparison with pre-industrial levels.   This goal is necessary.   But, as the small island states show, it is not sufficient.   We therefore need a UN agreement which is ambitious, which is comprehensive, which is fair and which is binding.   What does that mean? Lets look at these four elements individually.   First comes ambitious: For the very first time, more than 170 countries  -  industrialised nations, emerging economies and developing countries  -  have submitted information on their intended national contributions towards reaching the 2°C target.   The good news is that these relate to 95% of CO 2 emissions worldwide.   The bad news is that the submitted INDCs wont be enough to reach the 2°C target.   At this Summit we must therefore state credibly what we can do in the coming years in order to meet the target.   We will be required, no more and no less, to undertake a far-reaching decarbonisation of our economies in the course of the 21 st century.   Secondly, comprehensive: Comprehensive means that we need a fundamental transformation of our societies embracing all sectors, including industrial production, mobility, energy generation, thermal insulation and energy efficiency.   Germany has set itself clear targets.   We are going to reduce our CO 2 emissions by 40% by the year 2020.   And by the year 2050, we want to have reduced emissions by 80 to 95% from a 1990 baseline.   We have already agreed an ambitious climate protection package comprising more than 100 measures.   Renewable energies are already the central plank in our energy mix.   This year they will account for more than 27%.   Thirdly, fair: Fair means that the industrialised countries have to play a leading role as regards the development of decarbonisation technologies.   It was us who caused the emissions of the past.   Now we have to develop the technology needed to reduce emissions in the future and to make it possible for developing countries to reduce their emissions.   Germany will participate in various programmes.   We will, for example, double our research funding for clean energy.   We must also provide financial aid to ensure sustainable development is an option available to the poorest and most vulnerable countries.   Here in Paris we have to show that we can deliver what we promised in Copenhagen and make available US$100 billion a year from 2020  -  each and every year  -  so that others can beat climate change.   In this context Germany will double its public aid, taking 2014 as the base year, for the years to 2020.   And fourthly, binding: We need to create a framework for a binding UN agreement.   We also need a binding review mechanism.   Germany would like to see reviews happen every five years, starting before 2020.   We know that countries contributions are made on a voluntary basis.   But it is also important that we live up to our commitments.   We cannot allow any of these contributions to be watered down over the years.   On the contrary, they will have to be augmented.   We need transparency regarding the methods of measurement if our pledges are to be credible.   Ladies and gentlemen, ambitious, comprehensive, fair and binding  -  a global climate agreement should and indeed must be all those things.   This is a question of both ecological necessity and economic common sense.   It is a question of intergenerational equity.   It is a question of our humanity, and on it depends the future of the human race.   Germany will make its contribution so that we can look ahead to a livable future.   Billions of people are pinning their hopes on what we do in Paris.   Let us do everything we can not to dash those hopes.   Thank you very much.","Statement by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the United Nations Climate Change Conference",2015-12-01,"Germany","A.Merkel",806,"en"
"8","doc73801","Secretary-General Ban, Emir Al-Sabah,Your Majesty King Abdullah, Prime Minister Davutoğlu, Prime Minister Salam, Erna Solberg, David Cameron, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, Allow me also to thank David Cameron and the British Government for their hospitality here in London.   Ladies and gentlemen, the film that we saw at the beginning serves as another striking reminder to us of the tragedy that is unfolding in Syria.   The films final words, ""We must act now"", are nothing less than a urgent appeal, an appeal that we intend to respond to at this conference today.   There is really no more time to lose.   Three hundred thousand people have already lost their lives and millions have been uprooted.   This catastrophe must end.   As the Secretary-General of the United Nations has already said, we need a political process.   I would therefore like to offer my sincere thanks to Ban Ki-moon and Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, as well as to all of the other negotiators for their work to promote a political process.   We must also send a clear signal today that this current period of reflection must be used in order to improve the humanitarian situation in Syria, including a cease-fire - this is what the people expect  -  in order to actually drive the political process forward.   All actors share responsibility for this  -  but above all the Assad regime, of course.   Today, the priority is to ease suffering and to offer prospects for the people seeking refuge in Syria and neighbouring countries.   This should be a day of hope for these people.   I would like, first of all, to express my sincere thanks for the willingness shown by countries such as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey to offer refugees shelter.   They need our support.   As regards the most essential aid - daily food rations - we saw in the past year how cutbacks were made that were unbearable and how this forced people to flee.   This is why the Federal Government is pledging a total of one billion euros to the humanitarian aid programmes of the United Nations for 2016.   We would like to contribute 570 million euros of this sum to the World Food Programme - this is approximately 50 per cent of the funds that the World Food Programme needs for these three countries this year - so that we will hopefully be able, at the end of today, to say that we no longer have to worry about food rations.   We want to do more, of course.   We want to provide food, clothes, accommodation and employment.   This is why we are also supporting the Partnership for Prospects programme.   Examples of projects in the context of this programme include community centres, schools and hospitals that are built by the refugees themselves, thereby helping them to find gainful employment.   In 2016, Germany will contribute 200 million euros to this programme, thereby taking our support for this year to 1.  2 billion euros.   Another aim behind this is to establish a measure of security for the coming years, of course.   This is why we will be making a further 1.  1 billion euros available in 2017 and 2018, which will bring Germanys contribution to a total of 2.  3 billion euros.   I am also most delighted that the European Union has gone that extra mile by agreeing to make a total of three billion euros available to Turkey for projects to help refugees.   I would like to mention a further aspect that we intend to get under way, namely partnerships between municipalities.   We will set up an Internet-based communication platform for this and encourage the Länder and cities of Germany to enter into partnerships with cities in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey in order to offer them their help.   Perhaps you could also promote this initiative in your countries.   Moreover, we will also offer 1,900 higher education scholarships for Syrian refugees so that they can further their training.   Ladies and gentlemen, if we all work together and if we all do our part, then this can be a day of hope today - hope for people who have experienced, and unfortunately continue to experience, so many terrible things.   While this day will not replace the political process, it can offer a measure of humanity and hope.   I hope that we will achieve this much.   Thank you.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the opening of the Supporting Syria and the Region conference in London on 4 February 2016",2016-02-04,"Germany","A.Merkel",702,"en"
"9","doc73791","President Nakao, may I extend a very warm welcome to Germany to you and all representatives of the ADB.   We are delighted to be able to hold this years Annual Meeting of the ADB Board of Governors in Germany.   I think it really is high time Germany had a chance to host the meeting.   I would of course like to thank Federal Minister Gerd Müller and Parliamentary State Secretary Hans-Joachim Fuchtel for having done their utmost to make you feel at home here.   That is certainly the impression I get.   Naturally I am pleased that we have some high-level guests here today.   I would like to extend a warm welcome to the President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi.   Mr Mayor, I think you, on behalf of everyone in the city of Frankfurt, are a good host.   You have plenty of experience of conferences and trade fairs.   But you also have major competition.   You are aware of how dynamically the countries of Asia are developing.   Frankfurt will have to work hard to keep up with all the other places around the world where the ADB staff here today are also gaining experience.   I would also like to welcome all the members of the German Bundestag and the parliaments who are here today, including, I see just now, local matador Heinz Riesenhuber, whom I will greet as a representative of you all.   Ladies and gentlemen, the fact that so many people are attending this meeting is an expression of our great determination to do all we can to ensure sustainable development around the world, to gradually remove inequalities around the world and to create decent conditions for everyone in the world  -  over seven billion people now.   The 21st century is often referred to as the Asian Century.   If we consider the progress we have made in terms of the Millennium Development Goals, it is clear that this progress would have been utterly inconceivable without Asia.   Here is one piece of good news at least in a world in which we hear so much bad news every day: since the year 2000, we have succeeded in halving global poverty.   That we have been able to do so is essentially due to the economic upswing in Asia.   But the rapid demographic development and speedy economic growth in some places do raise a few questions.   What form should development cooperation take? What is still needed? Should our commitment not be directed at other regions now, or is Asia still the focus? We need to remind ourselves that, depending on how you calculate it, up to two-thirds of the worlds poor live in Asia.   In other words, combating poverty is not yesterdays news in Asia either, but a very topical issue.   When we think that in 2015 we set ourselves another ambitious goal, namely to eradicate absolute poverty by 2030, then we know it will be impossible to do this without Asia playing its part.   Just as Asia has been so successful in relation to halving poverty over the past 15 years, so we, and of course you in the ADB, want it to be successful in implementing the Development Goals over the next 15 years.   If a region is seeing dynamic economic development, it goes without saying that development cooperation needs to approach different aspects.   It is not only the case that the Asian countries already account for one-third of value added in global GDP; they are also contributing one-third to CO2 emissions, for example.   In other words, the countries of Asia are particularly affected by climate change, and by the question of how to arrive at a carbon-free existence before the end of this century.   Last year did see another bit of good news, of course: an international agreement was reached in Paris.   Work to implement this programme is now underway.   So our development cooperation, too, concentrates very strongly on climate protection and climate change mitigation, in other words on attaining the two-degree goal.   At our intergovernmental consultations in India last year, for example, we promised support to the tune of 1.  5 billion euros, one billion of which will go towards developing the use of renewables in India.   We want to expand such forms of cooperation.   We, the industrialised states, have pledged to provide 100 billion US dollars annually as of 2020 to support climate protection in poorer countries.   The Federal Republic of Germany intends to double its climate funding by 2020.   The Asian Development Bank has announced that it will do the same.   This shows that our goals largely coincide.   Today we have together launched the Asia Climate Financing Facility.   The aim of the Facility is to promote the development of climate protection projects as well as climate risk insurance, which we consider to be very important, and, above all, private-sector climate funding.   Last year, when we held the G7 Presidency, one of our priorities was to try to support climate protection projects.   We launched a G7 initiative aimed at insuring up to 400 million people in the worlds poorest regions against the effects of climate change.   I am profoundly convinced that insurance solutions like this will be very important in future.   At any rate, we need to move more towards realising that a combination of government and private-sector efforts is the solution.   We will never be able to provide all the financing needed from the public purse, but instead need to use public money to find intelligent ways to offer state incentives, multilateral incentives for private investment.   This was one of the things we talked about today, President Nakao.   The ADB and other development banks, for instance the AIIB, can set standards; they have the know-how and expertise; they can drive developments.   The whole thing needs to be combined with efforts by the private-sector.   The ADB is the worlds biggest regional development bank.   The reform of the Asian Development Fund has given it greater room for manoeuvre.   I believe this is a step in the right direction.   President Nakao, you personally did a great deal to bring about these changes.   For that I wish to thank you most sincerely.   Because the Bank is now in the position to work more consistently towards the agreed climate and sustainability goals and, in this context, to do precisely what I was just talking about, namely get private banks onside.   I think we should regularly talk to each other about how the private sector can be better involved.   We were also talking earlier about how we can make the projects financed by the ADB more sustainable, more long-term.   You need to be the trendsetter and, as it were, set benchmarks for the question of how long such projects are viable.   Short-term action is no longer enough.   Let me assure you that Germany stands ready as a partner.   What can we as a partner offer you? We know from our own experience in Germany that growth and energy consumption can be decoupled.   We are convinced that competitiveness and sustainability can be reconciled, that they are not mutually exclusive.   We believe that structural reform for climate protection will pay off in the long term and indeed even in the medium term.   We have also proven that more efficient technologies can create jobs, resulting in employment and, in turn, in prosperity.   In many countries undergoing very dynamic economic development, we get the feeling that the people escaping from poverty and forming a new middle class have new demands when it comes to quality of life.   Ultimately, there can only be a good quality of life if there is good environmental protection.   In our view, economic growth in the 21st century needs to be both socially and ecologically sustainable.   You know that we are from the land of the social market economy.   Ludwig Erhard is the symbol of this social market economy, which evolved from an economic theory to a practical model of society, a model of community life, in which everyone bears responsibility  -  not only the employers, but also the workers.   I believe that this model is fit for the future and that we can apply it just as well to the environmental dimension.   Of course, in a social market economy you often hear this question: how can we create decent working conditions? That is why we, and in particular Federal Minister Müller, have taken up what is undoubtedly a tough challenge, namely watching international supply chains, such as the chain from the cotton plants to the t-shirts sold in the worlds rich industrialised countries.   Supply chains are something like bridges between poorer and richer countries.   Given that we all know that the digital age, the internet age, is an age of transparency, we can definitely assume that it will be impossible to hide terrible working conditions in a country of production from the consumers in a rich country for ever.   Consumers in richer countries increasingly want to know under what conditions a product has been made.   The subject of supply chains is one we want to take up in the G20 Presidency after our G7 Presidency and which we are already discussing with our Chinese colleagues, as we are cooperating in a troika.   I dont think we should let ourselves become discouraged.   One piece of good news I heard today is that in future all ADB projects are to be oriented to the agreed ILO standards on supply chains.   Here the ADB is setting a good example and making these standards better known.   We must continue along this path.   One last point I would like to touch on today is the subject of vocational training and expertise, which will become more important in connection with the issue of supply chains.   I am pleased that the German Government and the ADB are cooperating on this too.   How well are workers trained? How good is their knowledge? How well can they cope with new developments? How well are they protected against accidents at work?  -  I think there will be more and more questions like these in the next few years.   Germany will be happy to cooperate with you on dual vocational training, as we call it in Germany.   Ladies and gentlemen, the few challenges I have mentioned today  -  climate protection and the quality of the environment, particularly in large cities, supply chains, fair trade, transparency regarding working conditions, fair sharing, training for people in all countries  -  are in themselves enough to show that you are facing huge challenges, but also that you are taking them up and facing up to them.   Thats why I hope that this meeting will bring you to the greater attention of lots of private banks ready to enter into cooperation and that the ADB can engage in a valuable exchange of experience in its regional work for Asia and also of course across the bridges it builds to non-regional supporters, among which Germany is happy to number itself.   I wish you all the best and fruitful talks! Everything you do, every project you get up and running, helps us to combat poverty, helps us to enable more people to share in success.   Germanys experience with the many refugees who have come to our country is that if we do not tackle the root causes of flight, if we do not ensure development everywhere, then people will set off on journeys which are far more dangerous for them and far more complicated for us all.   That is why I wholeheartedly wish you every success and a good meeting here in Germany.   I hope you will be able to take some time to enjoy Frankfurt and its quality of life.   One thing you must do, I think, is try Frankfurts green sauce.   Thats a speciality here.   It has nothing to do with environmental protection, but is a concoction of herbs.   So, whenever you get the chance, try green sauce and ask all about the ingredients.   All the best to all of you.   Thank you.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the 49th Annual Meeting of the Asian Development Bank Board of Governors in Frankfurt am Main on 2 May 2016",2016-05-02,"Germany","A.Merkel",1990,"en"
"10","doc73781","Secretary-General Ban, President Erdogan, Ladies and gentlemen, Conflicts and disasters cause immeasurable suffering and create new challenges for humanitarian assistance.   The truth is that to this day we do not have a sustainable humanitarian system.   Many people are thus following our meeting here in Istanbul very closely.   For this reason, I would like to thank the UN Secretary-General for taking on this painful topic and, after carefully preparing the Summit, launching our efforts today.   I would like to thank Turkey for its hospitality and for making it possible to hold this Summit here in Istanbul.   What do we need? Firstly, we need a renewed global consensus on humanitarian principles.   It is actually a disaster in itself that we have to talk about the need to respect international law.   Nevertheless, we are seeing in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere that hospitals are being systematically bombed, health centres destroyed and doctors killed.   Such actions are a flagrant breach of humanitarian principles.   We must be successful in getting help to the places where it is needed.   We must be successful in ensuring humanitarian work can be carried out on the ground.   We must all work together to achieve this end.   Secondly, the priority has to be to make aid function as smoothly as possible.   We must not simply go from one situation to the next, from one disaster to the next.   What we need is a cohesive system of humanitarian aid.   Above all, we need those supporting humanitarian assistance to be reliable.   Many a pledge is made without the money arriving in the project.   That must change.   Germany supports the proposal to increase the volume of the Central Emergency Response Fund to one billion US dollars.   Also on the German side, we are going to spend more money on humanitarian assistance.   We need operative crisis facilities and not just action when disaster strikes.   Thirdly, we need to break new ground.   We need to learn from one another here.   Every time we need to identify and implement the most efficient and best methods.   I would advocate that we also give insurance models a chance alongside classic financing, for example, insurance models connected to the risks associated with climate change or global epidemics.   The advantage is that assistance can be given quickly.   Those with an insurance claim are no longer perceived as people with their hand out but as people who have claims.   Insurance models could thus really bring a turnaround.   Fourthly, it is a matter of networking our activities.   Prevention, development cooperation and implementing Agenda 2030 that was adopted last year have to go hand in hand.   Today, monocausal explanations of conflicts are no longer valid.   Conflicts have multiple causes  -  from climate change to hunger, civil war and many other factors.   That is why we need to tackle the problem from different angles.   And that is why the tools need to be dovetailed.   Today the implementation of an inclusive system for global action is being launched to help people in need and to make clear: We all live on one planet, we all have one life, we all have the right to live this life sustainably and sensibly.   That is why we need to give everyone opportunities.   There are too many today who do not have these opportunities.   Thank you very much for organising this Summit.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel during the plenary of the World Humanitarian Summit on Monday, 23 May 2016, in Istanbul",2016-05-24,"Germany","A.Merkel",550,"en"
"11","doc73771","Mister President, dear François Hollande, Presidents of the Regional Councils, Minister-Presidents, Your Eminencies, representatives of the Jewish and Muslim communities, Mister President of the European Parliament, Mister President of the European Commission, Ladies and gentlemen, and, last but not least, dear young guests, The French lieutenant Alfred Joubaire was hardly older than you when he lay in a trench near this very spot.   He wrote in his diary that ""not even hell could be as horrific as this"".   With these words, the young lieutenant was attempting to describe the horrors he had witnessed  -  they were written by a person who should have a long life before him.   Only shortly afterwards, Alfred Joubaire was dead  -  one of the countless casualties of the battle of Verdun.   Behind us is the ossuary, which houses the mortal remains of more than 100,000 unnamed soldiers.   Here, we are surrounded by an ocean of graves.   To this day, the earth holds remnant bones of young Frenchmen and Germans who were robbed of their lives.   The entire landscape still bears the scars of that battle.   Here, history is uncomfortably close.   Verdun still has us in its grip.   Verdun can and must remain in our consciousness.   Verdun stands for the sheer horror and senselessness of war.   At the same time, however, Verdun is a symbol of yearning for peace, of overcoming enmity, and of Franco-German reconciliation.   Even in the heat of battle, there were moving and humane gestures.   Wilhelm Ritter von Schramm witnessed near Verdun how German and French soldiers waved and threw rations to one another  -  I quote: ""The French were more generous than we were.   Most importantly, they handed us what we urgently needed, namely water.   Thats how much fraternisation there was; it was the first fraternisation I had ever experienced, and it was not recorded in any war diary, because we made sure knowledge of this would not spread.  "" It is hardly possible to find a more convincing description of the absurdity of war  -  not only because even in the hellish environment of the battlefields of Verdun humanity could not be completely extinguished, but also because war still is possible, even though, in most people, everything bristles at the thought of it.   We must always keep our eyes open for, and be alerted by, the first signs of war, so as to nip it in its bud.   After the First World War, efforts were made to create long-term peaceful coexistence in Europe.   Aristide Briand and Gustav Stresemann, the foreign ministers of both countries, were even awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1926 for their endeavours.   And yet, in the long run, the voices advocating reason and mutual understanding were still too weak to make themselves heard.   We all know well which dark years would follow.   National Socialist Germany brought indescribable suffering to Europe.   After the Second World War and the Holocaust, it was more or less a miracle that the door to rapprochement and reconciliation was opened by the signing of the Élysée Treaty in 1963.   The bonds of trust established by French President Charles de Gaulle and Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer are invaluable, and they have been passed down to us.   More than two decades later, French President François Mitterrand and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl stood, side by side and holding hands, at the graves of Verdun.   This gesture says more than any words could express.   It was and still is an expression of deeply-felt solidarity.   And today, again, we jointly commemorate the many who died at Verdun.   All of them fell victim to the same aberrations: to bigotry and nationalism, to delusion and political failure.   The best way for us to honour the memory of the victims is to time and again recall the lessons that Europe has drawn from the cataclysms of the 20th century: These are the ability and the willingness to realise how vitally important it is to not cut ourselves off, but to remain open-minded in all our encounters.   Of course, it may sometimes require great effort to extend a hand to others and to familiarise ourselves with their points of view.   But only by opening up to one another can we also learn and benefit from each other.   That precisely is the key to Europes success.   It is particularly apparent these days, when we are also witnessing weaknesses in our community.   Still, I maintain that the 21st-century challenges we face can only be tackled together.   With European integration, we have left behind us the trenches of enmity.   We have gained peace and prosperity.   We have overcome quite a number of crises during which we feared the many things weve accomplished through integration may forever be lost.   After the recent Franco-German Council of Ministers, President François Hollande said: ""We have always managed to overcome the obstacles in our path"".   That is exactly why today, as well, despite numerous difficulties and setbacks, we can confidently set our sights on the future.   In the European Union, we will at times different opinions on certain issues.   That is only natural.   However, all sides will benefit if, in the end, we always prove that we are able to reach compromises and adopt common positions.   Thinking and acting as pure nation states would set us back.   We would not be able to successfully defend our values or promote our interests, neither internally nor abroad.   This is true for overcoming the European sovereign-debt crisis, for dealing with the many people who have come to Europe seeking refuge, and for all other great present-day challenges.   We must visibly demonstrate on a daily basis our shared commitment to the fundamental values of freedom, democracy and the rule of law.   France and Germany have a special obligation to uphold these values in the heart of Europe.   French and German soldiers stand shoulder to shoulder in NATO.   They are also engaged in joint operations: in Mali, in the Mediterranean and as part of international coalition efforts to fight the Islamic State terrorist organisation.   The Franco-German Brigade, which is participating in this commemoration ceremony, embodies our close cooperation based on trust.   Ladies and gentlemen, during the battle of Verdun, Europes heart appeared to stop beating.   By contrast, does it not fill our hearts with joy to see how, today, on this former battlefield, so many young women and men from France and Germany have gathered as a symbol of how enmity has been overcome and replaced by the present-day friendship between our two countries? This is a place of remembrance, and at the same time it is a place of hope for a bright common future.   Dear François Hollande, I want to express my heartfelt thanks for inviting me to this joint commemoration ceremony.   We in Germany were deeply touched by the French Republics invitation to share a moment of remembrance at this historically significant and highly symbolic site.   Three flags fly over this memorial: the French Tricolour; the German black, red and gold; and our common European flag.   We are no longer separated by trenches.   As friends, we together commemorate the past and jointly shape our future.   Luckily, we now stand united.   May this never change.   Thank you.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the battle of Verdun",2016-05-29,"Germany","A.Merkel",1191,"en"
"12","doc73761","President Bai Chunli, Minister Hao Ping, Professor Chen Jun, President of Nanjing University, The President of the University of Göttingen, whom I am very happy to see here today, President Ding Zhongli, Students, Ladies and gentlemen, First and foremost, I would like to thank you for the honorary doctorate from Nanjing University.   Above all, I would like to give my warm regards to the professors and students in Nanjing.   I only travelled as far as Beijing today, and not to Nanjing, but I remember my visit to the University very well indeed.   It was very lively and we had intense discussions on topics such as women in politics and science.   I wish you all the very best for the future.   An honorary doctorate stands for two things: the existence of close ties and the wish to strengthen these ties.   I am very pleased to accept the honorary doctorate from Nanjing University that you are awarding me today on behalf of the Peoples Republic of China here at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.   I regard this both as a sign of close personal ties and of the good relations between our two countries.   It is a sign of optimism, also as regards these relations becoming even closer in the future.   When I see so many young students before me, I am reminded of the time when I myself attended seminars and lectures.   From my own experience, I know that the path to new approaches and knowledge begins when one first questions what one has known so far and thinks about what else one can still learn.   It is only possible to ask oneself such questions in an atmosphere of freedom, creativity and discussion.   To my mind, these are key characteristics of academic institutes.   In other words, if one wants progress, one must allow and maintain openness and freedom in research and teaching, as well as in the academies and universities.   Cooperation can expand such openness and freedom.   This is why it is very important that we remain open to sharing knowledge internationally and with one another, but also to learning from one another.   One of the most famous German natural scientists, Alexander von Humboldt, once said: ""The most dangerous world view is the world view of those who have never viewed the world.  "" With this in mind, the German Alexander von Humboldt Foundation now supports exchange between distinguished researchers from all over the world.   I was very pleased to hear just now that there are close relations with Max Planck institutes, the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, the Helmholtz Association and other scientific institutes in Germany.   This is a good thing.   It is an integral part of the strategic partnership between Germany and China, which we are now expanding via a wide ranging plan of action that includes over 100 projects.   The current German-Chinese intergovernmental consultations play a role in this.   By the way, one advantage of intergovernmental consultations, if they take place regularly, is that one has to continue and complete projects and present progress reports.   This has greatly intensified our cooperation.   I think it is never too early for any of us to start fostering open-mindedness and transnational learning.   This is why we made 2016 the German-Chinese Year of School and Youth Exchange.   We are supporting schools that offer courses to teach the partner countrys language and providing funding for exchange visits, stays with host families and many other things that allow us to learn from one another.   We have non state organisations to thank for much of what is on offer.   These include research institutes, chambers of commerce, foundations and non governmental organisations.   All of them help to foster understanding and comprehension.   Mutual understanding leads step by step to trust.   For such work to have an impact, one naturally needs a legal framework that offers enough flexibility.   This is why I will work to ensure that civil society organisations are able to continue enriching our bilateral relations  -  relations that necessitate exchange on all levels and in all possible fields  -  under Chinas new law on non governmental organisations.   Every time I visit China, I am amazed by the countrys rapid development  -  by the growing network of transport and education infrastructure and the dynamism of the megalopolises.   All of this also means that living conditions are improving each year for many people.   I think it is safe to say that Chinas path is unique.   It was certainly an extraordinary achievement to open the country to market forces, to learn from others and to reinvent oneself, thus giving some 500 million people opportunities to move out of extreme poverty.   This fostered Chinas rise.   And this dynamism is also the basis of our cooperation.   Great challenges, which China also faces, demand reliable partnerships.   Germany wants to be a reliable partner for China.   This is why we have held intergovernmental consultations at regular intervals since 2011.   We will meet for the fourth time tomorrow.   The prerequisite for a reliable partnership is that one shares fundamental principles and beliefs.   This includes the rule of law, which is a crucial component of the constitution in Germany.   During my trip to China in 2007, I visited the Sino-German Institute for Legal Studies.   I was very impressed by the fact that Nanjing University and the University of Göttingen had set up this institute as early as 1989.   It does not only foster dialogue between the Chinese and German legal cultures, but also educates students from our two countries.   Given the wide recognition the institute enjoys and the continuity of its work, this cooperation is very special.   That is why it is also part of our bilateral rule of law dialogue.   This dialogue is complemented by our rule of law programme, which we use to train Chinese judges, lawyers and notaries.   Germany has plenty of experience, for example in setting up a modern administrative jurisdiction and running a petition system.   We are happy to share this knowledge with our partners in the Chinese Government.   The rule of law dialogue provides us with a forum to discuss our understanding of the law, share experiences and launch concrete projects.   The annual human rights dialogue is particularly important to us in Germany.   It enables us to present our views on human rights issues.   We do not always see eye to eye.   We can try to find solutions or to work together on improvements.   At the heart of the rule of law is the idea that the strength of the law applies  -  not the law of the strong.   This means that the judiciary makes decisions purely on the basis of applicable law, that is, independently of the political system.   It also means that everyone is equal in the eyes of the law.   It includes transparent processes and decisions.   Our understanding is of a rule of law  -  not merely a rule by law.   This type of rule of law strengthens peoples trust in state institutions and their decisions, and thus also fosters social stability in a country.   In this context, it is also very important  -  and this has been Germanys experience  -  that legal proceedings must not only be thorough, but also completed within a certain period of time.   If one has to wait too long  -  and one often has to wait a very long time in Germany  -  then it does not help if one receives justice, but the matter is no longer relevant.   Apart from that, it is very important for any company that needs to calculate and plan  -  be this at home or abroad  -  to be able to count on a reliable legal framework.   German companies  -  the members of the business delegation are also here with us today  -  have invested some 60 billion euros in China to date.   This shows how important it is to also have a clear legal basis.   Conversely, Chinese investors interest in Germany has continued to grow.   There are already some very lively discussions on this topic.   However, I want to underline once again that this is the reciprocity we have.   Chinese companies will naturally also enter the German market.   In view of our closer economic relations, legal certainty issues have of course also become more important.   By the way, Chinese companies in Germany also ask us many questions about the German legal system, which is perhaps not always so easy to understand and with which one first needs to familiarise oneself.   In our opinion, a legal frameworks merit is judged in part by the extent to which it treats foreign and domestic companies equally  -  for example in the case of public tenders  -  and ensures effective protection of trademark rights, patents and data.   Reliable and transparent regulations are of the utmost importance to innovative companies in particular, for example in sectors that we in Germany define as Industry 4.  0.   Collaboration in the high tech sector is largely a question of trust.   To this end, we need clear regulations and very effective legal protection.   The latter can be created by rule of law structures with independent courts.   China and Germany are working on implementing their mutual agreements to refrain from industrial espionage in cyberspace.   In my opinion, the more progress we make in this area, the more we can get close joint projects in the field of Industry 4.  0 off the ground.   The close connection between the rule of law, adherence to established regulations and fruitful cooperation in a spirit of mutual trust can in fact be seen on all levels  -  both nationally and internationally.   Showing commitment to the norms of international law by adhering to the rules is thus the cornerstone of the international system.   Trust can only develop between larger and smaller countries and between richer and poorer countries when sovereign countries make and uphold voluntary commitments.   China has helped to shape modern international law.   The country plays an active role in the United Nations and is a permanent member of the UN Security Council.   It is a member of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.   It has also been a member of the World Trade Organization since 2001.   China is a signatory to many multilateral agreements.   I think one can say that on the one hand, China itself has benefited from the stability of the established international legal framework.   On the other hand, the country has expanded its role in international bodies step by step and in line with its economic rise.   We expressly welcome this.   The Peoples Republic of China currently holds the Presidency of the G20, the group of the 20 leading industrialised and newly industrialising countries.   We will all meet in Hangzhou this autumn for the summit of the Heads of State and Government.   China has set itself an ambitious agenda.   We are very interested in working with China in this process.   Germany will host next years G20 summit.   This is why we want to carry parts of the agenda forward, thus creating close cooperation.   Chinas increased economic weight must be taken into account internationally.   There was a lengthy discussion on changing the voting shares in the International Monetary Fund.   Germany was in favour of China being granted greater voting shares in the IMF and World Bank, as this reflects its greater economic strength.   We supported the inclusion of the renminbi in the basket of currencies in the IMFs special drawing rights.   This will start on 1 October.   And we are also the largest shareholder from outside the region in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which was founded on Chinas initiative.   In our view, the fact that China is playing a constructive role internationally is simply the logical outcome of its greater economic strength.   With economic strength comes greater responsibility.   After all, a look at the map of the world shows how many conflicts we have to overcome worldwide.   China is needed as a pillar of the established international order.   This was shown for example in the E3+3 nuclear talks with Iran, which we were able to bring to a successful conclusion after many years.   It is also shown in the six party talks with North Korea that have not yet proved so successful.   But why should we not also work even more closely together on the other challenges we need to overcome together? Afghanistan is one example.   I am pleased that we will also work together on a very practical level in joint projects to help rebuild this ravaged country.   In the pilot phase, we plan to provide funding to Afghan disaster relief organisations and to work together in the field of mining training.   China is also very active in Africa  -  and not only in business, but increasingly also in humanitarian and peacekeeping measures.   Mali is an obvious example of where Germany and China could work together.   We would welcome such cooperation, as we ourselves are providing support in Mali.   China has recently taken on great responsibility internationally as regards protecting the climate.   The Paris climate agreement would not have come about had the United States and China not worked very intensively together and had China not been one of the authors of this agreement.   The deal reached at the climate conference in December last year and the agreement by the United Nations on sustainable development goals are two major multilateral achievements, which we now need to implement intensively.   These examples of Chinas commitment have generated trust, which now should be reinforced  -  including in the case of tensions we are currently seeing, for example in the East and South China Seas.   I am pleased that we can also say as part of our dialogue that China and Germany are committed to upholding the maritime order on the basis of international law, including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the freedom of navigation and overflight firmly laid down in it.   It is in the interests of all countries to uphold this order and to maintain stability in the region.   Both China and Germany support peaceful solutions to territorial disputes and issues involving maritime rights  -  peaceful solutions in line with international law, regional arrangements and bilateral agreements.   Let me say frankly that Germany would be pleased if, for example, a binding code of conduct were to be agreed with the ASEAN countries and China.   Ladies and gentlemen, as you see, we have plenty to do.   Much work lies ahead of us.   Much trust has grown.   Much intensity is found in our cooperation.   We regard our partnership as a win win situation for Germany and China.   This should also enable us to aim for pragmatic solutions in areas where there are still differences of opinion.   I am very grateful indeed to be welcomed here today ahead of the German-Chinese intergovernmental consultations.   I would like to thank the initiators from Nanjing once again for awarding me this honorary doctorate.   I now look forward to lively discussions with the students and audience.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on receiving an honorary doctorate from Nanjing University on 12 June 2016 in Beijing",2016-06-20,"Germany","A.Merkel",2476,"en"
"13","doc73751","Minister Mezouar, Minister El Haite, Federal Minister Hendricks, Ladies and gentlemen, Excellencies, I am delighted to be here once again this year.   I still remember last years dialogue.   At that time, we were unsure about what outcome we would be bringing back when we met again in a years time.   Today we can say a heartfelt thank you to all the participants, especially the French Government for its marvellous work in arranging the Paris climate conference - with great skill, with great dedication, and with extensive diplomatic experience.   We were very happy that Franco-German cooperation also played a truly positive role.   When Minister Mezouar thanked Christiana Figueres just now and wished Patricia Espinosa all the best and I looked around at the women who are the Environment Ministers of Morocco and Germany, I thought: gender equality has already progressed quite a lot in relation to climate protection, and women are playing a strong role in its success.   I hope Minister Mezouar can handle my saying this.   Of course, I too wish the very best to the new Executive Secretary of the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and once again thank Christiana Figueres very much for the work she has accomplished.   As I have already mentioned to Ms Hendricks, I am a bit envious of her upcoming trip to Marrakesh, a place where I have never been in my life.   I think Morocco will be a wonderful host.   We find ourselves - here at what is now the seventh Petersberg Dialogue - in a new era, for there is now a binding global climate agreement.   Alongside the many difficulties of the past year, it was really good news that this succeeded.   We can state that in Paris the whole global community pledged to curb climate change for the first time.   All of the countries committed themselves to the goal of keeping global warming below two degrees and, if possible, limiting it to 1.  5 degrees.   All of the countries agreed to do their part.   Their contributions will be reviewed every five years and adjusted in reference to the global target.   The Paris Agreement is thus proving to be a historical milestone in international climate protection.   It is a sign of hope.   It can have a positive influence on the living conditions of billions of people.   The parents of this Agreement can be truly proud.   People have put a lot of their hearts and minds into the negotiations in recent years.   I would also like to underscore that major actors who were not so active for many years - here I want to mention the United States and China - helped a lot in bringing about this Agreement, and also carried along many others.   In this respect, the signs are looking quite optimistic in this situation.   As the apt saying from football goes, after the game is before the game.   Thus, the process is continuing.   We have a new stage before us.   If one thinks this through carefully, the matter becomes even more serious.   Obligations have been taken on.   And now they must be honoured.   As we in the Federal Government are currently in the process of coordinating our climate protection plan, I surmise that this will still demand a great deal from many others, too.   But for a start we can say that no international agreement has ever previously been signed by as many countries as quickly as the Paris Agreement.   On 22 April of this year, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted a celebratory ceremony in New York.   More than 170 countries took this as an occasion to sign the Agreement.   The Agreement only enters into force when it has been ratified by 55 countries which are responsible for at least 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.   Some countries - above all, threatened island nations - already ratified the Agreement at the ceremony in New York.   Additional countries - including the United States and China - have announced their intention of taking this step this year.   This is very important.   We as the Federal Government will be dealing with the bill for ratification of the Paris Agreement tomorrow in the Federal Cabinet.   We want to attempt to complete the entire process before the climate conference in Marrakesh.   We want to then present the instrument of ratification together with the European Union and the other Member States and thereby to send a clear signal that Europe is implementing the outcome from Paris and is pulling together in the same direction when it comes to climate protection.   A great many things are in motion, not only in Europe, but in every region of the world.   The global transformation has already begun.   The expansion of renewable energy sources is developing with especially rapid momentum.   Last year global investment reached a new record high of 286 billion US dollars, meaning that more than twice as much was invested in renewable energies as in fossil fuel power generation.   This is an absolutely clear sign.   This welcome global trend is a result of better framework conditions, lower costs and concrete expansion targets.   The task now, of course, is to make this trend a permanent one.   In Germany, the shift to green energy has set a clear course in any case.   By the way, we will be holding the second and third readings of the 2016 Renewable Energy Sources Act in the German Bundestag this week.   With this law, we will be beginning a new phase.   Renewable energy sources are already the most important pillar of energy production in Germany.   We will now be shifting from supported prices that are fixed by the Government to a tendering process.   This is a qualitative leap forward.   We in Germany have already set ambitious targets for ourselves.   However, the expansion of new pipelines is turning out to be a bottleneck here, and also requires a very high level of acceptance from the public.   We still have a lot of outreach to do in this area.   We are not the only ones who have set ourselves ambitious targets.   India, for example, wants to develop 175 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2022 - including 100 gigawatts of solar energy.   The country has also announced that it is doubling its tax on coal extraction.   The revenues from this tax are to be dedicated to environmental projects.   China will be tripling its solar capacity by 2020.   We are looking forward very eagerly to the introduction of emissions trading in China in 2017.   Morocco, the host country of the next COP, will raise the share of renewable energy sources in its energy capacity to 42 per cent.   This too is a highly ambitious target.   One can say, then, that things are moving forward.   But we need progress not only in the area of energy, but rather in all sectors: in business, in transport, and in private households.   In my view, three aspects of the Paris Agreement are especially important here: we need to develop long-term strategies, we need to further develop our climate contributions regularly, and we need conclusive answers to questions regarding funding and incentives.   Regarding the first point: the fact that we need long-term strategies is obvious because we have determined that we will make this century a century of decarbonisation.   This will be especially dependent on long-term investments, both public and private.   The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate estimates that by the year 2030, more than 90 trillion US dollars will be invested worldwide in infrastructures, including for energy, transport and water.   The task here is to shape these investments in a climate-friendly way.   It is interesting that the extra costs associated with this are actually quite low.   They are estimated to lie between 0.  3 and at most 4 per cent added onto the investment costs.   But in return, we will have climate-friendly investment.   I do not want to play down these additional costs.   But we have known at least since the Stern Review that in the long term  - and in fact even in the medium term - they pay for themselves.   When we consider what consequences of climate change we will otherwise be in for, we know that this is certainly worth it.   This means that the success of Paris will in practice play a crucial role in determining what investments are made in the coming years.   At the end of May, the G7 countries agreed at their summit in Japan that they would take on a leadership role on this issue and would present their respective strategies well before 2020.   The work on this has already begun.   I previously mentioned the climate protection plan that we are working out in Germany and that describes the steps towards the target of lowering emissions by 80 to 95 per cent by 2050 in comparison to 1990 levels.   The year 2050 is really not so far away anymore.   It is now 2016, so we have less than 35 years left until then.   If one considers the lifespan of power plants and many other things, one sees that this timespan is in many cases only one investment cycle long.   The target of 80 to 95 per cent contains quite a large margin.   This is precisely the focus of the political discussions that the Federal Environment Minister currently has to expect.   At EU level, we have agreed that if at all possible, we will develop a climate strategy for the coming decades by 2018.   Work is also underway on long-term plans in the United States and Canada.   Ultimately, all countries are called upon to develop long-term strategies - not only with an eye to climate protection, but also with an eye to future opportunities for growth and prosperity: Ultimately, the question of whether we are even able to have a successful economy at all is at stake in climate protection.   That is why the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, upon which the international community also agreed last year, are so closely connected.   Along with long-term strategies, we also naturally need concrete climate contributions quite soon.   This is the second crucial point when it comes to breathing life into the Paris Agreement.   The fact that all countries have offered voluntary climate contributions is very welcome.   As the Foreign Minister has said, however, the sum of these contributions is not enough to keep warming below the two-degree threshold.   That is why it is so important to us for there to be a revision every five years.   These revisions will certainly be painful too, because one will be able to see very clearly how far we have come.   I have recently had another look at the rise in global CO2 emissions.   The series of figures from 1990 to the present day looks truly threatening.   Germany and Europe are adhering to an ambitious mechanism.   We are prepared to improve.   We in the European Union have set ourselves the target of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 by at least 40 per cent compared to 1990.   We have formulated this as a minimum target.   We are, then, leaving quite open the possibility of changing this contribution once again after further reviews.   I want to say, however, that even achieving a 40 per cent reduction is definitely ambitious.   We will once again be holding discussions about burden sharing on the basis of the recommendations that the Commission is developing.   Targets are fine, but they must be backed up by reasonable funding.   This is the third component.   The Paris Agreement obligates us to reconcile our financial flows with low-emission, climate-friendly development.   The starting point is the positive thing that remained from the Copenhagen conference, which is the pledge to provide 100 billion US dollars annually to poorer countries from public and private sources beginning in 2020.   In Paris this pledge was affirmed and extended to 2025, at which point a new funding target must be agreed.   A roadmap for how these 100 billion dollars are to be attained by 2020 is currently being developed in a working group of industrialised countries.   At this point I would also like to say that the OECD has provided a great deal of support to us on many aspects of all of these issues.   With numerous funding pledges and initiatives, the industrialised countries are already on a good path.   The G7 is also playing a sound role in this.   When we in Germany hosted the G7 last year, we launched some concrete initiatives.   By 2020, Germany intends to double its contribution compared to 2014.   But of course we also know that public contributions are only one part of the equation.   We also must interlink them with private investments in a savvy way.   Development banks play a key role in this.   The World Bank, the Asian, African and Inter-American Development Banks, and not least the European Investment Bank all want to increase the contribution to climate financing in their portfolios considerably.   In this sense, development banks are, so to speak, also strategic trailblazers for private investments.   At this point I would like to emphasise that what matters at the end of the day for all affected countries, especially for small island nations, is that the money really arrives.   At some point, the moment of truth comes.   Then there is no more theoretical juggling of funding amounts.   Projects need to be realised.   We need to really produce what we have promised.   A large number of private investors are acting of their own accord.   In this connection I would like to mention the example of the Carbon Disclosure Project, which is supported by more than 820 institutional investors with assets of more than 95 trillion US dollars.   This CDP initiative calls upon companies worldwide to disclose their CO2 emissions and their climate risks.   A working group of the Financial Stability Board, that is, the international body for overseeing the financial system is currently working on recommendations for the disclosure of climate-related risks.   I find this to be a very interesting contribution.   Previously when one spoke of the FSB, it was generally when dealing with banks that were of systemic relevance or shadow banks.   But the fact that this body is now also engaging with climate-related risks shows that climate protection is finding its way into the broader issue of the global financial system.   Given that the global financial system has already placed many burdens on us, it would be nice if the global financial system played a more positive role in the issue of climate protection than it did during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009.   These are all very good approaches.   Some things have started to move.   More than 90 countries, which together are responsible for 61 per cent of global emissions, also want to use national or international market mechanisms of placing a price on carbon.   I think that here we can learn from one another how these systems can be shaped.   We know from European experience how difficult this can be and how closely tied it is to economic development.   What might have been expected as an automatically functioning system 20 years ago nonetheless must be coupled with economic development in a savvy way, of course.   At this point I would like to say again that I consider this to be a correct approach.   A carbon price directs investment towards low-carbon infrastructures, technologies and products.   Such a price ensures that emissions are reduced in the places where it is possible to do so in an especially cost-efficient way.   It also yields public revenues that can be used for climate finance both domestically and abroad.   Of course, questions of international competitiveness arise very quickly in this context.   That is why we are also following Chinas actions with close interest.   That is why we wish for other countries with which we compete to also take similar steps.   That is why we need a global carbon market in the medium-to-long term so that we can have truly fair conditions for competition.   In the field of finance this is known as a level playing field.   We need this to avoid ending up with permanent readjustments and exceptions.   We still have a lot of work to do in grappling with this.   Last year, as part of the German G7 Presidency, we started a platform to foster international dialogue among governments in order to explore forms of cooperation for developing a global carbon market.   At this point I would like to highlight the activities of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund to promote global carbon pricing, which I gladly support.   As you have probably noticed, the OECD, the World Bank and the Financial Stability Boards are all now involved in these activities.   Years ago this was not the case.   And this certainly shows that this trend is going to become much more pronounced.   Price incentives will play an increasingly important role in international transport.   World population growth suggests that we will have to expect further growth in the transport sector.   That is why we face an important decision this autumn at the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization.   We want to adopt a binding global market-based measure through which further growth in aviation beginning in 2020 is to become climate-neutral.   This is to be achieved through project-based offsetting of emissions.   In addition, we should harness the momentum from Paris for a second major project this year and agree upon the reduction of partly fluorinated hydrocarbons that have an impact on the climate under the Montreal Protocol.   This too would be a significant contribution to complying with the provisions that were set in Paris.   On the whole, we can state that sticking with the multilateral approach after the disappointing Copenhagen conference in 2009 paid off for us.   Protecting the climate is a global task that can only be dealt with globally.   Of course, we are aware that we hold differing degrees of responsibility for climate change, that its consequences impact us differently, and that we have different opportunities to meet this challenge.   This remains our philosophy, from the Kyoto Protocol to the present day.   Nonetheless, a lot of things have changed dramatically since Kyoto, including the global role of economies.   That is why it is so important that the major industrial nations are taking on a leadership role.   We will attend to the questions connected to this, especially during Germanys G20 Presidency.   Next year Germany will host the G20 Summit.   In doing so, we will work very closely with the OECD once again.   We as a global community on the whole depend on the emerging economies and developing countries pursuing, or being able to pursue, a path of transformation.   In this area, we want to lend our support to developing nations, especially through a global partnership that was initiated by Germany.   I am pleased that Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks and Development Minister Gerd Müller officially launched this initiative yesterday.   In this initiative, governments around the world and international institutions support developing countries in the drafting and implementation of their national climate strategies.   At the same time, these national climate strategies also serve the goal of overcoming poverty and opening up new economic prospects.   Initial talks this spring showed that there was interest on all sides - among donors, multilateral organisations, and the countries themselves.   This is encouraging.   The first concrete outcomes regarding the shaping of global partnership are to be presented in Marrakesh.   Germany has pledged to finance a secretariat and to provide support in terms of staffing.   It is to be led by the World Resources Institute and headquartered in Bonn and Washington.   We also want to support the new partnership through our International Climate Initiative and within the framework of our development cooperation.   Ladies and gentlemen, the Paris Agreement points us in the right direction.   I have tried to make clear that while this path has been pointed out, we have not yet begun to follow it; that we have many partners in walking this path; and that we also still have many obstacles to overcome.   The task at hand is to create and safeguard prosperity - and to do so not at the cost of the foundations of life, but rather on a sustainable path.   It is no exaggeration to say that climate protection is no more and no less than a question of survival.   Let us therefore breathe life into the climate agreement.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Seventh Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin on 5 July 2016",2016-07-08,"Germany","A.Merkel",3345,"en"
"14","doc73741","Nuncio, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the chance to welcome you warmly to Meseberg together with the Federal Foreign Minister, the Minister of State in the Federal Chancellery, and several State Secretaries.   I hope that you all found your way here easily.   This was rather more difficult back in the days before GPS; today it is somewhat easier.   We would have liked to invite you here last year and the year before that, but unfortunately the weather was bad, so we did not want to ask this of you.   Good things take time and the third time is the charm, as the sayings go  -  and now, the third time, things have worked out without the weather thwarting our plans.   I would definitely like to invite you to come to Meseberg again another time.   It is a wonderful place.   You can walk around the lake, and the neighbouring hotel is a terrific place to eat and to stay.   So if you from the Embassy side want to take an excursion into the countryside some day, Meseberg lends itself as a good travel destination.   Ladies and gentlemen, in comparison to rescheduling a diplomatic reception, it is often much more difficult to react appropriately time after time in the day-to-day business of diplomacy when things happen differently than expected.   All of you have experience with seeking new approaches again and again.   In many areas it takes a lot of patience and tact to keep lines of communication consistently open despite certain differences and to seek solutions.   But the willingness and ability to engage in dialogue have value in and of themselves.   This is something that we know all too well against the backdrop of European history.   A few weeks ago French President François Hollande and I stood at the graves of soldiers who lost their lives 100 years ago in the Battle of Verdun.   The First World War was the result of diplomatic and political failure.   Such visits remind all of us, time and again, that it is better to try one time too many to keep the lines of communication open than one time too few.   The fact that we  -  I mean Germany and France  -  are able today to commemorate the dead together in friendship is due to the diplomatic skill and political foresight that the fathers and mothers of European unification demonstrated.   For me, the unification of Europe is and remains a priceless stroke of good fortune, to which we owe both our life in peace and freedom and our high standard of living.   Together as the European Union, we are better equipped for major tasks of our times than each Member State alone would be.   The British referendum has changed nothing about this.   The fact that a majority in the United Kingdom has come out in favour of leaving the EU, however, is something that I and the entire Federal Government deeply regret.   This decision is a bitter turning point.   I remain, however, firmly convinced that the European Union is strong enough to bear this caesura, too.   It is now up to the United Kingdom to communicate its wish to exit officially to the EU.   Only then can the process begin.   We also agreed on this at the recent European Council.   The United Kingdom will have to clarify quickly what form it wants its future relationship with the European Union to take.   I can only emphasise from the German side that the United Kingdom is an important partner to which we want to remain closely connected in the future.   Of course, however, the EU and the remaining 27 Member States must safeguard their interests.   Whoever would like free access to the European single market, for example, will in return have to accept all of the fundamental freedoms, including free movement of persons.   After the referendum, we in Europe certainly cannot simply return to our daily business as usual.   We must consider together what lessons we will draw for the further process of European unification.   This will start with a special meeting in Bratislava in September.   Naturally, many people are asking whether the answer lies with ""more"" or ""less"" of Europe.   In my view, such a discussion falls short.   We need a successful Europe.   This is the goal that we must pursue.   We must increase Europes competitive strength and bolster its research and innovation in order not only to maintain our position in promising economic sectors, but also to set standards ourselves as Europeans.   This is also a necessary condition for us to be able to offer our young people better future prospects than we can today, for far too many people in Europe are affected by unemployment right now.   We need structural reforms.   We need sound finances.   And, above all, we need energy and drive to truly advance innovation.   When we met in this group a year ago, I had come from Brussels the day before.   Once again, the European Heads of State and Government had been dealing with the so-called Euro crisis.   It was clear to everyone that there could be no simple solution process.   But at that time we agreed on a path nonetheless.   And I can say today that we have indeed made progress.   Things work better together  -  this is the conviction that sustains Europe.   A year ago, a new challenge was already looming, one that has put precisely this European community spirit to the test again: Refugees have fled their homes in large numbers due to war, violence and lack of opportunity, to seek protection elsewhere or to start an entirely new life.   In August 2015, for the first time, more than 100,000 refugees arrived in the Greek islands via Turkey.   This was the beginning of an unprecedented refugee flow via the so-called Western Balkan route to central and northern Europe.   Taking in and caring for so many people in such a brief period has been an enormous effort.   We in Germany know this from our own experience.   Our country has offered protection to hundreds of thousands of men, women and children.   In doing so, we are and have been able to depend on many professional and volunteer helpers, who have clearly risen to the occasion.   But at this point I also want to thank all of the countries neighbouring Iraq and Syria that have taken in refugees.   Europe has not taken in the most refugees; rather, it is countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan which are particularly affected.   In the past year, however, we have also learned that we must budget our energies.   This means that we have to focus on those people who are truly in need of protection, which is why I have stressed our three essential objectives from the outset: we want to reduce the number of refugees, noticeably and permanently; we want to replace illegal migration with legal migration and remove the foundation for the people smugglers inhuman business; and we want to create a shared solution.   The EU-Turkey Agreement meets these requirements.   Since its implementation, far fewer refugees have been undertaking the dangerous journey across the Aegean.   But, of course, this does not mean that the problem has disappeared from the world.   On the contrary: the number of refugees and internally displaced persons worldwide has sadly reached a new record level.   The UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimates more than 65 million worldwide now.   This unimaginable number in itself makes clear that we as a global community are needed here.   That is why Germany held a conference on Syria at the beginning of this year together with the United Kingdom, Kuwait, Norway and the United Nations.   The meeting in London set new standards for international support.   Firstly, we were able to raise more than twelve billion US dollars to improve the situation of Syrian refugees.   Secondly, the conference also initiated changes in the countries taking in refugees in the region.   They have gradually opened up their labour markets to refugees and offered school places to children.   What Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan are accomplishing here, as Ive said before, truly merits respect.   In the course of the Supporting Syria & the Region Conference, Germany pledged 2.  3 billion euros  -  1.  3 billion of it for 2016 alone.   This made Germany the largest donor, but many other countries also announced generous help.   But the most important thing now is for the money truly to reach people.   We have seen that families could scarcely endure the situation when the funds for their food rations were lowered from 30 dollars per person per month, which is already very little, to 13 dollars.   Of course, remedying the causes of flight and displacement is even better than mitigating their effects.   That is why we continue to focus our efforts on bringing peace to the conflict in Syria.   Our Federal Foreign Minister is intensely involved in this.   The basis for a political transformation process is that the agreed ceasefire is respected and that it is possible for the millions of internally displaced persons to receive assistance.   There must be an end to the use of outlawed weapons such as barrel bombs.   There must be an end to targeted attacks on hospitals and humanitarian personnel.   There must be an end to starvation policy.   We have a changed situation in Syria as a result of Russian intervention on the side of the Assad regime.   Naturally, we therefore expect Moscow also to be intensely involved in finding a viable political solution.   Fortunately, talks are underway.   Consultations with the United States are also being held.   I hope that by the time of a reception like this one next year, the situation in Syria will be better than it is now.   Whether in Syria or elsewhere, the fight against the so-called Islamic State will go on.   We must systematically remove the raison dêtre of its followers, so that the seed of hatred can no longer sprout.   The victims of the recent attacks in Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh, in Baghdad and Istanbul, admonish us to do this.   At this point I would like to recall the victims of the cowardly attacks in Brussels and Paris once again.   After the terrorist attacks in its capital, France invoked the EU mutual assistance clause.   This was the first time that any Member State had exercised this option from the Treaty of Lisbon.   As a consequence of this, Germany, among other countries, has expanded its military engagement against IS.   IS has since lost large parts of the territory it had acquired in Syria and Iraq.   We support the Iraqi Government in enabling refugees to return to the areas that have been liberated.   The task here is, above all, to reconstruct vital infrastructures.   At the same time, we must prevent terrorist gangs from taking advantage of the unstable situation in Libya in order to proliferate there.   Germany and the European Union are strongly committed to making it possible for solid state structures to be established in this afflicted country.   The Libyan Political Agreement of last December was an important incremental success.   It was negotiated by UN Special Representative Martin Kobler.   The situation in the country, however, remains highly tense.   We need more recognition and support for the unity government.   This also applies to constructing a new security architecture, of course.   There is scarcely any country today that can be observed in isolation.   That is why our horizon extends beyond Libya to the entire region.   The streams of refugees from various countries across the central Mediterranean are only one more reason for this.   When we see how many people have already drowned in the Mediterranean, despite our utmost efforts to save human lives, we can see that time is running very short.   Germany and the European Union will expand their migration partnerships in Africa.   This is a twofold approach.   Firstly, it is to better secure the borders, to effectively curb people smuggling and illegal migration and to facilitate repatriation.   Secondly, we must help to improve the opportunities that are available to people in their own home countries.   We are prepared to do so, but what we expect of our partners  -  if I may say so  -  is responsible governance and willingness to engage in positive cooperation.   The European Union has now become an internationally recognised actor through its broad-ranging involvement worldwide.   There is still room, however, for it to live up to its increased responsibility even more.   What is pivotal here is our European Common Security and Defence Policy.   This can be shaped in an even more effective and strongly results-oriented way.   We must develop both civilian and military capacities.   This is to be regarded not as competing with NATO, but as supplementing it.   It was also very good that the EU and NATO concluded a cooperation agreement at the last NATO Summit in Warsaw.   The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has been and remains crucially important to us.   Together, the members defend the values and principles that have shaped our post-war order and secured us a life in peace and freedom.   The day before yesterday, we returned from the two-day NATO Summit in Warsaw.   There were three strong messages.   Firstly, we underscored solidarity within the alliance.   Security is indivisible.   This commitment is the main pillar of the Euro-Atlantic security architecture.   Secondly, we committed ourselves to doing our part to deal with challenges such as collapsing states, terrorism and civil war.   The alliance has a vested interest in stabilising the situation in the European neighbourhood.   Thirdly, NATO reaffirmed its offers of dialogue to Russia.   Yes, there are differences.   But this makes it all the more important for us to exchange views and to speak to each other, not about each other.   We are interested in serious, results-oriented talks.   It is a good thing that a NATO-Russia Council will be taking place on Wednesday.   Of course, this talk will particularly address Ukraine and the Ukraine conflict.   This conflict cannot be resolved militarily.   But it can be resolved through political, peaceful and diplomatic means.   The Minsk agreements continue to show the way towards this.   What is decisive now is implementation.   Some steps have been taken, but many still lie ahead of us.   As a partner in the ""Normandy"" format, Germany joins France in supporting the work of the trilateral contact group.   We seek to continue mediating.   Germany is also using its OSCE Chairmanship this year to work out viable approaches to solutions.   Security policy issues also play a role in our work as the G7 and the G20.   While these have traditionally been economic and financial policy forums, global challenges such as geopolitical conflicts, climate change and epidemics undoubtedly also have an impact on economic trends and prospects.   In view of our many interdependencies, it is crucial not just to react to undesirable developments.   Risks must also be identified as early as possible, foreseeable consequences must be analysed, and effective precautionary measures must be taken.   It is therefore important to create an international framework with principles and rules and to strengthen the institutions that enforce this framework.   At the end of the year, Germany will take over the G20 Presidency from China.   One key priority will be taking up the central idea of the social market economy.   This means that we want to put more emphasis on economic competitive strength and social responsibility as a single unit, for the two of them are mutually dependent in their form and development.   Along with fundamental issues of regulatory policy, we will of course go into greater thematic detail.   We also want to pick up on some of the initiatives that we have already launched under the German G7 Presidency.   These include, for example, the area of health.   We are thinking, among other things, of conducting a pandemic drill.   We are also keen to work on a common approach to antibiotic resistance.   And we will be discussing the crosscutting theme of digitalisation, as increasing interconnectedness will still entail many profound changes  -  in production, in trade, in the workplace, in mobility and also in consumer protection.   At the G7 Summit in Elmau, we agreed that internationally recognised labour, social and environmental standards had to be better implemented at all points along the global value and supply chain.   We also want to take up this topic at the G20 Summit.   We need global unity not least for the practical implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.   In a years time, the Summit of Heads of State and Government will take place in Hamburg.   It will be preceded by a series of ministerial meetings as well as meetings with civil society and other actors.   As is usual in the G20, international organisations and several guest countries will also be invited.   Germany is using its G20 Presidency as an opportunity to take on international responsibility, as it did with the OSCE Chairmanship this year.   We would like to communicate to our partners in the world that they can rely on us.   The European Championship in football ended yesterday.   I congratulate Portugal most warmly.   We share your joy.   We would also like to thank France for taking on the role of host in times that are not easy.   It was a wonderful celebration of sport.   Perhaps this evening in smaller discussion groups we will also see those who neither hosted the event nor won every game licking their wounds.   In any case, we know that football brings people together and football generates enthusiasm.   And sometimes we also experience disappointment together.   I would once again like to welcome you here most warmly.   Thank you so much for the long journey you have taken to be here.   We hope you will not be disappointed.   I wish us all a lovely evening.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Annual Reception for the Diplomatic Corps in Meseberg on 11 July 2016",2016-07-18,"Germany","A.Merkel",2938,"en"
"15","doc73731","Mr Ischinger, Esteemed colleagues, Distinguished participants of this years Munich Security Conference, The Internationale Wehrkundetagung in 1963 marked the start of an annual free and frank discussion  -  an event that has had a significant impact each year and remains a forum for discussion on a wide range of topics in the form of the Munich Security Conference.   People from 125 countries are attending this years event.   And as Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, I would like to welcome them all warmly to Munich.   The Minister President of Bavaria will of course also welcome the guests because Bavaria is something very special in Germany, but as Federal Chancellor, I also wish to do so.   Until 1990, this conference was dominated by the Cold War and the uncompromising confrontation between two blocs, as well as by nuclear deterrence.   Thanks to the western partners cohesion and strength, we were able to experience the end of the Cold War and the achievement of the goals of values based cooperation, particularly those of transatlantic cooperation, in 1990.   This is why I would like to bid a very warm welcome once again to the delegation of the United States of America, and of course especially to the Vice President and to all those who have travelled from the United States.   A very warm welcome to you! Since then, the world has changed dramatically.   Today, over a quarter of a century later, we no longer have two blocs.   There is a new type of order.   There is a new balance of power.   The structure has become far more multilateral, but we still have a super power  -  the United States of America  -  and we still have a transatlantic link.   We have a united Europe with 28 members.   We have seen the rise of emerging economies, particularly in Asia.   To spell this out even more clearly, I looked at how gross world product has developed when I was preparing for this conference.   We can say that it more or less tripled in the 25 years between 1990 and 2015.   The United States GDP has also tripled.   The European Unions GDP has only doubled as regards the 28 Member States.   Chinas GDP has increased 28 fold.   This means the EU now has a share of 22 percent of gross world product compared with its previous share of 31 percent.   The United States of America has been able to maintain its share of one quarter, with a slight decrease from 26 to 25 percent.   And Chinas share has increased from two to 15 percent.   That is an example of the shifts we are witnessing.   We are facing asymmetrical threats, particularly that of Islamist terrorism, starting on 11 September 2001.   There are new conflicts as a result of civil wars, population growth and climate change.   There is growing interdependence as a result of globalisation and the spread of digital technology.   This means we do not have a fixed international order.   Despite the end of the Cold War, relations with Russia remain on shaky ground  -  I say that now from a European perspective.   I firmly believe that the challenges of todays world cannot be overcome by any one country alone.   These challenges require joint efforts.   This is why I believe we need multilateral international structures, which we must strengthen and make more efficient.   This goes for the European Union, NATO and the United Nations.   And it goes for a forum for which Germany is responsible this year, that is, the G20, whose presidency Germany currently holds.   This group was set up at the level of Heads of State and Government in 2008 in response to the international financial crisis.   Prior to that, it had only existed at Finance Minister level.   At the time, we were only able to resolve this far reaching global crisis by working together.   This was a good example of how we can also take multilateral action.   That is why we chose the motto ""shaping an interconnected world"" for the G20 Presidency  -  in the firm belief that joint action strengthens everyone.   However, we now need to acknowledge that multilateral structures are not efficient enough in many areas, with the result that members of the public in almost all of our countries are asking if the multilateral approach is really the right one as regards solving problems or if there is a way to withdraw into protectionism and isolation.   I firmly believe that it is worth fighting for joint international multilateral structures.   However, we need to improve them in many ways.   In this regard, I would like to start with what we need to improve at home, that is, in the European Union.   The European Union is in an exceptionally difficult phase.   The outcome of the UK referendum means that we will no longer have 28 Member States in the future, but rather only 27.   In my opinion, this is unfortunate  -  but it is a fact.   The 27 Member States must ask themselves all the more how they can make their European Union a success.   There are many things with which we cannot be satisfied.   First and foremost, the single market is the hallmark of the European Union.   This single market, which also needs to be further expanded in response to the challenges of digital technology, must be of benefit.   This means jobs, competitiveness and prosperity for the people.   The social market economy in Germany was always a sound guiding principle for society as it led to prosperity for all.   And this is also what people expect of the European Union.   Secondly, we need to strengthen our single currency.   We have already experienced two profound crises in the European Union from which we have not yet fully recovered.   One reason for this is that after we decided to introduce a single currency, the euro, we were not sufficiently prepared for crises and only put security mechanisms in place afterwards in order to safeguard the euro.   We will need to continue working on this.   We have now also experienced the same thing as regards freedom of movement.   You can move freely and without border controls in most EU Member States.   But we were not prepared for the fact that pressure could arise at our external borders, for example as a result of refugee flows, and we had to take steps after this situation arose  -  through joint border police and many other measures  -  in order to safeguard this freedom of movement within the Union.   We will also need to keep working on this.   The European Union thus needs to learn to concentrate more on the truly important challenges, that is, on competitiveness, jobs, internal security and international security.   We will also need to think more in the coming years about where we have superfluous regulations that make our lives difficult and curtail our competitiveness.   It cannot be the case that once we have reached an acquis communautaire, as we love to call it, that this is the last word.   We must also allow amendments to be made.   Naturally, we want to maintain our friendly relations with the UK.   We will also do more in the field of defence policy.   The Treaty of Lisbon provides for structured cooperation between the EU Member States.   The German and French Defence Ministers have taken the initiative to do more in this area.   I think I am right in saying that almost all Member States say that, yes, if we want to be a security union, then we need to do more as regards defence policy.   The EU is currently conducting 16 military operations and missions around the world.   It covers over a third of the costs of UN peace missions.   It is the largest provider of humanitarian aid in both Syria and Afghanistan.   But we need to do more to join up military capabilities.   Our Defence Minister spoke about this in detail yesterday.   We need leadership within the European Union to allow us to design a joined up approach that can include development policy and good governance, not only military capabilities.   This will also enable us to make progress on an area that is particularly important to us in our relations with African countries, namely training and equipping soldiers locally.   That is also important.   I firmly believe that European defence capability can never be seen as an alternative to NATO, but must always fit in with NATOs capabilities.   We also share this view.   Particularly when it comes to defence cooperation, Franco German initiatives have frequently played a major role.   The Franco German Brigade was founded in 1989 and comprises 6,000 soldiers.   We are now working on joint procurement projects.   This is great progress.   Apart from military cooperation, Germany and France have extremely close ties in other activities, such as internal security.   When it comes to protecting the external borders, there are many Franco German initiatives, which will also become initiatives at European level.   As Mr Ischinger just mentioned, we took the initiative on an essential issue by establishing the Normandy format to address the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.   I know that further talks will take place on the margins of this conference.   Unfortunately, Mr Ischinger, I am unable to report that we have already met all the points in the Minsk agreement.   But this agreement remains the basis for further endeavours.   We need to continue working not only to further the political process, but also to finally ensure a lasting ceasefire, as people are profoundly unsettled when this does not exist.   The situation in Ukraine leads me on to NATO, the second major topic I wish to address.   NATO became even more important for what I would describe as a very sad reason, that is because of the annexation of Crimea and the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is supporting the separatists.   Why is this such a great concern? Why has it led to so much uncertainty? It has led to so much uncertainty  -  and we must repeatedly remind ourselves about this  -  because it violated the principle that brought us peace and security in Europe after the Second World War, namely the principle of territorial integrity.   This principle is something on which the European peaceful order has been based since the Second World War.   That is why we need to be so strict on this issue.   If this principle no longer exists, the entire European order will be destabilised.   That is why we  -  the NATO Secretary General is also here with us  -  saw the need to strengthen the eastern flank.   Germany is taking on responsibility for this in Lithuania; the United Kingdom is doing so in Estonia; and Canada and the United States of America are taking on responsibility in Latvia and Poland respectively.   We are doing this in the spirit of Article 5 and assuring each other of our joint capacities and our support.   NATO has also been active in Afghanistan since 2001.   This was where the fight against terrorism really began following the attacks on 11 September 2001.   Germany is still active, including within NATO, along with 20 other nations in northern Afghanistan.   I spoke with the Afghan President yesterday.   We also need continued military support here.   But we also need a political settlement in order to ensure a peaceful future for Afghanistan.   When we speak about NATO, these days the talk quickly turns to the financial contributions made by each member.   I do not want to steer clear of this topic.   Like all other countries at the NATO Summit in Wales  -  that was in 2014  -  Germany made a commitment to reach the two percent target within ten years.   I join the Defence Minister in saying that we will do our utmost to achieve this and that we feel committed to this target.   However, I would also like to add that NATO is profoundly in Europes interest, in Germanys interest and, I believe, also in the United States interest.   It is a strong alliance of us all.   That is why we will work hard and that is why we count on NATO being and remaining a project of joint interest.   Thirdly, ladies and gentlemen, there is a great threat.   With regard to the NATO mission in Afghanistan, I mentioned the threat of Islamist terrorism, which has constantly grown since then through IS and other organisations such as Boko Haram.   A Counter ISIL Coalition is now responding to this threat.   In my view, it is active far beyond the NATO Member countries, naturally in Iraq and Syria.   Germany is also involved in this coalition.   I just spoke with the Turkish Prime Minister.   We know how Turkey in particular, as a NATO partner, is adversely affected by the challenges of Islamist terrorism, by Da'esh and of course equally by PKK terrorism.   I want to say very clearly here that Europeans cannot win the fight against Islamist terrorism on their own.   We need the military strength of the United States of America.   I say this because Islamist terrorism is also being perpetrated very close to the European Unions external borders and thus has a strong impact on Europe.   This is another reason why cooperation with the United States of America is of course very important for us.   But it is equally important to me that we included Islamic, Muslim countries in this coalition, as I believe that these countries in particular must play their part in spelling out that the cause of terrorism is not ""Islam"", but rather a misguided form of Islam.   That is why I also expect  -  and I have said this on various occasions  -  the Islamic religious authorities to speak out clearly about the difference between peaceful Islam and terrorism in the name of Islam.   We who are not Muslims cannot do this in the same way the Islamic authorities can.   Ladies and gentlemen, terrorism has a wide ranging impact.   It leads to forced migration.   I want to underline here what countries around Syria and for example near Iraq have done to help.   Turkey has taken in almost three million refugees.   Jordan and Lebanon have reached the limits of what is feasible.   That is why we have a joint responsibility here  -  I want to state explicitly that the European Union also has a responsibility  -  to take in refugees, to address the reasons why people flee, and to help people in need properly.   We in Germany have taken on this responsibility along with a few European Member States.   Unfortunately, we do not have a joint position on this issue within the European Union.   But when you recall that Cyprus is one of Syrias neighbouring countries, then you see that our external borders also run directly alongside Syrias.   This is why we cannot simply opt out of the question of how people who have been forced to flee are faring.   We need to deal with this issue.   I would like to make a further remark on the fight against Islamist terrorism.   At the start of my speech, I said that we unfortunately  -  this is my own point of view  -  have not been able to establish stable and permanently good relations with Russia in the past 25 years.   But Russia is also a neighbouring country of the European Union.   Russia is situated at our external border and is a neighbour of ours.   That is why I will continue to advocate working towards good relations with Russia, despite our having different opinions on many issues.   For me, this means continuing to stand by the NATO Russia Founding Act and not abandoning it even if times are hard  -  I would like to thank the NATO Secretary General for repeatedly holding meetings between Russia and NATO  -  and it means looking for common ground in the fight against Islamist terrorism.   I believe that we share the exact same interests here and can also work together.   As a final point, I would like to speak about the role of multilateral institutions, particularly that of the United Nations.   The contribution made by the United Nations work to overall security in the world, as well as the fact that the UN Secretary General is here with us today, is very good and important.   After all, this conference now focuses on a very wide ranging definition of security that involves far more than the issue of defence cooperation.   And I think this is right.   Secretary General Guterres has put crisis prevention at the very top of the agenda of the United Nations future work.   I can only support that.   Every crisis and conflict that can be prevented and does not take place means we do not have to spend money on defence, but instead have a chance to foster development.   Africa is an important neighbouring region of the European Union.   That is why we need to put our heads together and think about how we can finally bring about dynamic development in Africa like that in Asia in recent decades, alongside classical development aid.   This will also be a topic of our G20 Presidency.   We have not come as far as I would like, but this is so important.   Thanks to smartphones and the spread of digital technology, people now know what life is like in other places.   The pressure caused by forced migration will only be overcome when there is development everywhere.   Ladies and gentlemen, we will address many of these topics during our G20 Presidency  -  the question of forced migration, the question of addressing the reasons why people flee, and the questions of global health and education, particularly the education of girls and women, so that they can live independent lives.   I would therefore like to invite all of you to support us in various ways in shaping the G20 Presidency.   Thank you for your attention.   It was an honour and a pleasure to give this speech today  -  in a year in which we all feel incredibly challenged and as if something is at stake.   Will we continue being able to take joint action or will we revert to our individual roles? I call on us to find joint positions and I hope we will do so.   Let us work together to make the world a better place.   It will then be a better place for each and every one of us.   Thank you very much indeed.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel on 18 February 2017 at the 53rd Munich Security Conference",2017-02-22,"Germany","A.Merkel",3019,"en"
"16","doc73721","Mr President, Fellow members of this House, Ladies and gentlemen! Before I begin, let me also bid a warm welcome to the Tunisian representatives; it is with pleasure that I look back on the opportunity I had, a few weeks ago, to address the Tunisian parliament.   We wish Tunisia every success in its work and on its difficult but so far very promising journey.   Fellow members of this House, the European Council will convene in Brussels this Saturday for the 27 member states which will in future make up the EU to discuss Great Britains departure.   The Brexit negotiations are sure to demand much of the European Union as well as of the UK over these two years.   That, I think, is beyond any doubt.   However, it is also beyond doubt that these Brexit negotiations will certainly not be the only challenge that Europe has to meet in the coming two years.   Let me therefore say a few words about developments in Turkey first of all.   The situation there cannot be left unmentioned in this debate, and I am sure it wont go unmentioned during our meeting on Saturday either  -  though I must point out that discussions pertaining to Turkey officially have to be held in the Council of all 28 member states, as the UK is still an EU member state with all the rights and responsibilities that entails, so the actual discussion will not take place on Saturday.   Before all else, it goes without saying that we respect the Turkish peoples right to decide freely and democratically on their own constitutional order.   That, I think, is something we take as read.   It is all the more worrying, however, to read the joint report by the OSCE and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the conduct of that referendum.   I would like to this opportunity to thank the members of parliament involved, and the head of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Michael Link, for their important work.   Their assessment is particularly significant, as it comes from independent observers.   The Turkish Government has to acknowledge this report and respond to the questions it raises.   The reports allegation that the two camps were not assured a level playing field during the referendum campaign is serious, as is its finding that fundamental democratic rights were curtailed under the state of emergency.   We will be following very closely how Turkey deals with the investigation of possible irregularities.   The same goes for what the Turkish Government does now to actually implement the constitutional reform and how it cooperates with the Council of Europe  -  including the comprehensive monitoring procedure that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted this Tuesday.   The tremendous concerns that the Council of Europes Venice Commission has expressed with regard to the process and the content of this constitutional reform are very worrying.   As a member of the Council of Europe, an OSCE participating State and a candidate for accession to the EU, Turkey must address those concerns.   Let us be quite clear about this: it is not compatible with the rule of law when the executive, in this case the Turkish executive, publicly prejudges a case, as in the case of Deniz Yücel.   The German Government will continue to unequivocally and repeatedly demand that Turkey comply with rule-of-law standards, including the precious assets of freedom of opinion and freedom of the press  -  with regard not only to Deniz Yücels fate but also the many criminal cases under way in Turkey generally.   It is beyond doubt that the developments of recent weeks have placed a severe strain on German-Turkish and European-Turkish relations.   In this situation, we will continue in our endeavour to return to constructive German-Turkish and European-Turkish dialogue.   The Foreign Ministers will meet today and tomorrow, and the Turkish Foreign Minister will join them for part of the programme.   It would not be in the interests of Germany or the EU for Turkey to permanently turn its back on Europe or  -  and I say this advisedly  -  for Europe to permanently turn its back on Turkey.   This situation therefore calls for prudence as well as clarity.   And it is with prudence and clarity that we will be discussing within the European Union precisely what consequences we consider appropriate at what time.   The German Government is aiming for the European institutions to act in concert on this matter.   Fellow members of this House, the invitation to next Saturdays special meeting of the European Council was sent out after the United Kingdom, on 29 March, officially notified the European Union of its intention to leave.   The UK Government is thereby putting into practice what a majority of UK voters decided in a referendum a little over ten months ago.   Just to reiterate this quite plainly, we  -  Germany and the other EU member states  -  never wanted Brexit.   But here again, we  -  Germany and the other EU member states  -  respect that democratic decision and are now looking to the future.   The official notification from the UK Government marked the start of the two-year notice period.   When those two years have passed, the UKs membership of the European Union will end, as outlined in the Treaties.   It is now up to us, the future 27 member states and the European institutions, to define our own interests and objectives for the coming negotiations.   The European Council will take the first step in that direction on Saturday and, in its 27 member format, adopt common guidelines for the negotiations.   After some intensive preparatory work that the German Government was of course involved in, Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, has submitted what we feel is a very good and balanced draft  -  and I want to sincerely thank Donald Tusk for that.   The draft reflects not only the full range of the 27 member states interests but also the overarching interests of the European Union as a whole.   My many conversations over recent weeks have shown that there is now a lot of consensus among the 27 and the European institutions about our common negotiating position vis-à-vis the UK.   We can therefore expect the European Council of 27 to send out a strong message of unity the day after tomorrow.   The European Councils guidelines will form the basis of the negotiating mandate which the 27 member states  -  in a further step, probably in late May  -  will give the European Commission.   That negotiating mandate will be considerably more extensive than the guidelines we adopt on Saturday.   However, I want to emphasise at this point that I, like Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, expect that the actual political negotiations with the UK will not and cannot really get going until after the UK general election on 8 June.   The European Union will be represented in those negotiations through the European Commission, by its chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.   Furthermore, I have pushed right from the start to make the consent of the member states indispensable to all important decisions throughout the negotiating process.   I stand by that position  -  as does the whole of the German Government  -  and the member states involvement is indeed assured.   After all, the departure of one EU member state will of course directly affect the interests of all remaining members.   We have three main concerns in these negotiations.   Firstly, we must safeguard the interests of our citizens, of the German people.   The focus here is particularly on the very real every-day issues confronting the many people directly affected by Brexit  -  most especially those citizens of Germany and other European countries who are currently living in the UK.   An estimated 100,000 Germans fall into this category, each of them with their individual life stories and very personal worries about an uncertain future.   Consider, for instance, a pensioner who moved to the UK from Germany years ago for professional reasons, bought a house there and is now, in her retirement, facing considerable legal uncertainty.   Or consider a young student in the middle of a university degree in Scotland, living the dream of a Europe without borders, and now worrying about whether hell be able to stay in the UK when he graduates.   Or consider a German couple living and raising their children in London, who need access to schools, jobs and health insurance on a daily basis.   I could add many more examples.   All of them are reasons why the German Government will be working hard in the negotiations with the UK to establish clarity and certainty on all these questions as quickly as possible in the interests of all the German citizens affected, so that they can make plans as required.   We will naturally do everything we can to minimise the potential negative consequences for our citizens everyday lives.   Conversely, of course, we are also prepared to then make a fair range of options available to the UK citizens living here in Germany and in other EU member states.   They are of course an important part of our community life and we intend that they remain so.   Secondly, we need to avert any adverse effects for the EU as a whole that could be caused if the UKs transition to its new status as a non-EU country does not go smoothly.   Business owners, for example, want to know whether they will still be able to sell their products in the EU and UK markets.   Researchers are asking whether they will be able to continue their collaborations with their UK colleagues.   To begin with, it is therefore essential to establish legal certainty about what the consequences of Brexit will be.   Wherever our interests dictate it, we will of course still seek close cooperation between the EU and the UK in future.   This will be the case, for example, in our joint fight against terrorism and organised crime and in our cooperation on security and defence policy.   At the same time, however, we will also make sure that, while cooperating thus, we always safeguard and consolidate the achievements of European integration.   I firmly believe that, even after the UKs departure, the European Union will remain a unique community of shared values and one of the strongest economic areas in the world.   Thirdly, we must strengthen the cohesion of the 27 member European Union.   Barely over a month ago, we were in Rome to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Rome Treaties.   All those involved took the opportunity to clearly reiterate our conviction that we are very clearly united for the better.   Sixty years of European integration is a unique success story, and the key will be to write the next chapter of that success story with 27 member states.   I will do everything to ensure that we 27 member states continue to stand together on all difficult issues just as we have done so magnificently since the UK referendum ten months ago; after all, we have managed to maintain a cohesive and unified stand despite our individual interests sometimes diverging.   It was anything but clear that we would manage that on the morning after the UK referendum, and we should take the time to acknowledge the achievement.   All 27 member states, the European Commission and the European Parliament have stuck to what we agreed at that time.   We have held no preliminary negotiations with the UK and refrained from anticipating any particular issues.   Instead, we  -  the EU  -  have been preparing well for the negotiations and closely coordinating our positions.   There are of course a lot of highly significant interests.   Consider Ireland and the common area it shares with the UK, or the problems in Northern Ireland.   It has therefore been a good achievement to stand together as we have.   The result today is that we are ideally prepared, both substantively and organisationally.   I particularly welcome the fact that the European Parliaments resolution of 5 April takes the very same line as we want to agree in the European Council on Saturday.   Let me also add that one of the reasons such an approach is indispensable is that we have to be ready for very complex negotiations between the EU and the UK which will ultimately require the approval of the European Parliament as well as the Council.   Over the United Kingdoms 44 years of EU membership, a complex tapestry of ties has developed that now needs to be unpicked bit by bit.   This will also meaning sorting out all the financial obligations that the UK fully committed itself to as an EU member state and that are valid until after the date of Brexit.   In our opinion  -  and I will add that I hope it meets with support  -  the negotiations on this cannot be left until the end; this is one of the most important aspects that need to be on the agenda right from the start.   The chronological order in our approach on this is clear, even though it will not always be entirely easy to stick to it: an agreement on the EUs future relationship with the UK can only be concluded once satisfactory arrangements have been reached on all aspects of Brexit.   This means that the quicker the UK Government is prepared to reach constructive solutions, the sooner we can discuss their wish to talk about the future UK-EU relationship before the Brexit negotiations have reached their conclusion.   But we first have to know what the UKs vision for our future relationship is.   It can only and will only work in that order  -  not the other way around.   That exact order is what the 27 member states will look for and insist on.   With progress on the many unresolved issues of Brexit, including the finance issues, it makes no sense to conduct parallel negotiations on details of the future relationship.   The European Commission, with Jean-Claude Juncker at its head and Michel Barnier as its chief negotiator, has made that position clear time and again.   Jean-Claude Juncker was in the UK yesterday with Michel Barnier and reiterated the position once more.   The Commission has the German Governments full support on this matter.   What is also clear is that a non-EU country  -  as the UK will be  -  cannot and will not have the same rights as or even enjoy better conditions than an EU member state.   On that too, all 27 member states and the European institutions are agreed.   Fellow members of the House, you are perhaps thinking that all of this actually goes without saying.   But I am afraid I have to say these things so explicitly at this stage, because I get the impression that some people in the UK are still cherishing illusions about them  -  which would be a waste of time.   Of course the future relationship between the UK and the EU, like the old one, will have to involve a good balance of rights and responsibilities.   If the UK is prepared to accept that, then there ought to be no obstacle to a close and long-term partnership with the European Union.   We, the European Union, certainly want a good, close relationship with the UK that is built on a spirit of mutual trust.   We too have an interest in seeing the United Kingdom prosper and succeed.   In a word, we will take a fair and constructive approach to these negotiations, and we expect exactly the same from the UK side.   Our objective will always be to achieve the best outcome for Europe and its people.   It is in this spirit that we will conduct these talks as a 27 member EU, and in this spirit we will hopefully bring them to a successful conclusion.   The parliaments will naturally play a hugely important role over the next two years.   As I see it, regular dialogue between the national governments and national parliaments will be crucial if the negotiations are ultimately to reach a viable conclusion.   The German Government and Bundestag will manage this with our usual procedures of close cooperation.   I want to particularly highlight, at this point, how robustly it strengthens the governments position in challenging negotiations to have the parliament backing it through such cooperation.   I must therefore most especially welcome the fact that the Bundestag has prepared a motion for a resolution on the negotiating guidelines, which is to be voted on today and the content of which very much corresponds to the Governments own stance and the position we intend to agree in the European Council on Saturday.   Mr President, fellow members of the House, ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the magnitude and, above all, the complexity of the task.   We are well prepared, but it will take a lot more work.   Our goal is to continue the European Unions success story.   We are and will continue to be guided by one aim, namely to ensure that people can live well in Germany and Europe.   We know that these are altogether challenging times.   The crises and conflicts in Europes immediate neighbourhood are too serious, too profound, too various, the global challenges of displacement and migration, of hunger  -  look at Africa now  -  and suffering too great, the challenges of world trade or climate protection too major for Europe to be in a position to concentrate only on itself for the next two years; Brexit doesnt change that.   We 27 want to continue to stand up for our values and interests on the world stage.   We want to do that for the good of the people of our unique, great community of values.   This is about them: the people, the 450 million citizens, as it will be, of the EU.   This is about the good life we share in Germany and Europe and its future in the coming years and decades.   I therefore humbly ask for your support.","Policy statement by Federal Chancellor Merkel",2017-05-08,"Germany","A.Merkel",2957,"en"
"17","doc73701","Professor Hacker  -  I am also including all of your colleagues from the G20 nations or their representatives, Minister-President, my dear Reiner Haseloff, Ladies and gentlemen, First of all, I would like to thank you for the work that you have done.   Science depends on curiosity, a thirst for knowledge, and the joy of discovery.   In science, one person builds on the insights of another.   It is precisely this that makes it different from politics.   In politics, one can feel comfortable saying the same thing two or three times because the audience is always different.   In science, however, there is the expectation that you wont repeat what a predecessor has already said.   In politics, one is sometimes pleased when two people in a party say the same thing.   Reiner Haseloff knows what I am talking about.   In science, interaction and cooperation are very important.   Openness and interconnectedness are virtually taken for granted as part of life.   This is also why science presents itself as a driver of globalisation on the one hand, and benefits from globalisation on the other.   The fact that globalisation exists also makes scientific activity simpler and more normal.   Three hundred and sixty five years ago, four doctors laid the foundation for the Leopoldina in order to promote the exchange of ideas in the medical and natural sciences.   Back in the era of stagecoaches, it was still somewhat more complex to communicate with each other than it is today in the digital age.   But the urge for knowledge and understanding, the urge to learn from and with one another, already existed back then.   The same rule that applied in those days still does today: Only those who demonstrate an openness to the world, and engage in cooperation beyond professional and physical boundaries, can fully benefit from it.   This is basically true for science, as it is for the economy.   In both areas, we increasingly face the same challenges through the growing interconnectedness worldwide.   Developments on one side of the globe have more and more impact on the other side of the globe.   This applies in a positive sense, just as it does in a negative sense.   One of the most concrete examples was surely the international financial and economic crisis at the end of the last decade.   Globalisation is taking place.   Whoever tries to evade it, whoever focuses on isolation and protectionism, may perhaps expect to gain some advantages in the short term.   However, it is clear to me that this will cause ones own innovative capabilities and competitiveness to weaken in the medium and long term.   After all, we find a great many examples of this in history.   In a closely networked world, we need  -  more than ever  -  answers that are consistent and dont undermine each other in their effects.   Therefore, global questions also require global answers.   The G20 at the heads of state and government level  -  I wish to repeat this  -  was the result of the financial and economic crisis in the years 2007 and 2008.   It was then that the heads of state and government met for the first time at G20 level.   Previously, this was a forum for finance ministers.   We saw back then that our joint action  -  concerning bank regulation as well as efforts to stimulate the world economy  -  actually made it more possible to deal with this global crisis.   At the beginning of July, the heads of state and government of the G20 member nations will meet for a summit in Hamburg.   On this occasion, too, we will have guests in attendance.   They are the representatives of regional organisations as well as representatives of international organisations, such as the United Nations, the IMF, the OECD, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization and the International Labour Organisation.   For this reason, too, G20 summits are always global meetings, as it were.   We have now included the scientific community, as well as other areas of civil society, in the summit process.   Civil-society groups will be present from the very start this time  -  such as representatives of the business community as well as the trade unions.   Also because of the good experiences from the G7 or G8 process, we had decided to expand the group of participants this year at the G20 level as well.   Therefore, this is a world premiere today, so to speak: the first meeting of science academies in the G20 format.   I thank you for making the journey, which involved very long distances and travel times in some cases.   I would also like to express my gratitude to Professor Hacker and his team, as well as all other participants, for deciding to convene here, for preparing the meeting, for thinking about the topics, for making a note of the conclusions, and all of this  -  Ill come back to it later  -  in sensible language that we, as politicians, can understand.   Apart from business and trade-union representatives, the other groups we will meet with include non governmental organisations, think tanks, women and young people.   As a result, this G20 process also has an impact on society.   In reference to science, it is clear that responsible policy depends on scientific recommendation.   This is self evident for us in national politics.   For this reason, we time and again seek the advice of scientists.   This is enriching for policymakers, I would say.   Naturally, I am also pleased that Minister-President Reiner Haseloff is here and has said that his daily work routine is also enriched by this.   I also thank the state of Saxony-Anhalt for being such a good host state for the German National Academy of Sciences.   If the budget is already secured for the next two years, then that is much more than I can predict for our budgetary commitments.   So, congratulations.   I mentioned earlier that you have developed a policy brief.   It is important that the language of science is translated in such a way that it can also be comprehended by non scientists.   In this sense, as presidents and representatives of your national academies, you are the builders of bridges into society.   Because when it comes to the many problems that we have to solve, we can only benefit from scientific knowledge.   This applies to the topic of health just as much as it does to other subjects, such as digitalisation, climate and environmental protection, poverty reduction, the empowerment of women, and the G20 partnership with Africa.   All of this is crucial for the shaping of sustainable development.   We have adopted the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda.   A topic that plays a central role in the 2030 Agenda is health.   The United Nations says in this sustainability charter that every person in the world is entitled to reasonable health care.   Of course, serious illnesses are a bitter stroke of fate for those affected and their relatives, first of all.   Many diseases also lead to life threatening situations or even to death.   But as Professor Hacker already said: There arent just individual repercussions; illnesses can also devastate entire regions economically.   They can cause social tensions and they can lead to violent conflicts.   Therefore, its not for nothing that the 2030 Agenda gives a great deal of recognition to the topic of health.   As I have said, we have already had the scientific academies present in the G7 process and focused on health issues.   We know  -  most notably from the Ebola crisis  -  that health issues can become a global topic very quickly and unexpectedly.   People travel today, in times of globalisation, from one place to another  -  and the pathogens travel with them.   The president of the World Bank, himself a physician, repeatedly points out the following: If we were to get another pandemic like the Spanish flu, as we had at the start of the 20th century, then the world  -  with the intense interconnectedness that we have today  -  would very quickly find itself in a very, very difficult state.   For this reason, a topic like health belongs on the G20 agenda.   Perhaps the related organisational efforts sometimes can be quite burdensome.   But I hope that you have also enjoyed getting to know each other.   Of course, I also express my gratitude for the communiqué, in which you deal with the issues that particularly concern us.   Professor Hacker, I agree with you: It is essential to have strong health systems on the ground in order to prevent the outbreak of epidemics.   Many epidemics could be confined locally if the health systems were sustainable and stable.   This is a problem that affects many poorer countries, in particular.   If you take one look at the African continent, you will know what a huge amount of work is ahead of us.   Therefore, German development cooperation has been drawing on exactly this point for years now.   In Africa alone, we will make available about 600 million euros by 2020 in order to improve health systems.   However, I would also add that good government leadership should always go with it  -  particularly in the cooperation with Africa  -  so that the funds dont get stuck somewhere ""unsustainably,"" as it were, but rather that sustainable structures emerge out of this financial support.   With the World Health Organization, we have also started the ""Healthy Systems  -  Healthy Lives"" initiative, which serves to develop a common understanding of how we can strengthen health systems in a sustainable way.   The goal is an action framework with specific agreements, with which we support countries in their efforts to provide better medical care.   I promote this project among the G20 partners as well.   Within the G7, we spoke on several occasions  -  including when Germany held the presidency  -  about strong health systems.   In 2015, when we hosted the summit, the G7 countries committed themselves to providing aid for at least 60 nations, in order to truly implement the international health regulations of the WHO.   We have clear guidelines from the World Health Organization, but we havent introduced them everywhere.   At the summit that followed last year in Japan, we broadened this goal.   On the list, there are now 76 countries that we want to support in the development of an efficient health system.   The G7 nations are doing this.   Of course, we also need the governments concerned to have their own initiatives.   Naturally, this process always involves evaluating the implementation of measures.   I may say that we have completed such an evaluation in 30 countries.   This is also planned for 30 more countries.   Strengthening national health systems is one aspect.   The other one is to be prepared for emergencies at an international level as well, if diseases were to spread internationally in spite of preventive measures.   In this case, the main issue is speed.   A rapid response is critical.   Medical staff, materials and mobile laboratories must be on the spot quickly in a crisis.   Sufficient money must also be available.   I would like to add one more point because it is very sensitive.   The World Health Organization is structured in such a way that it has regional offices.   These regional offices have a relatively autonomous status.   That means there is no chain of command from the head of the World Health Organization and no clear reporting obligation when something happens in a region.   Instead, it is largely at the discretion of the regional offices to report on it.   Naturally, there is then something similar to shame: If I identify a looming pandemic in my region, should I report it and thereby trigger an alarm worldwide, so to speak, with all the consequences that this could involve  -  a collapse of tourism, economic repercussions? Should I have the courage to make myself heard in order to prevent major damage? There has been much discussion about this at the World Health Organization.   The voluntary commitments  -  shall we say  -  were reinforced.   I am relatively optimistic that it will work better in future.   But this is, of course, a very important point.   Because in order to trigger an alarm and to start a chain of action, I naturally need someone to tell me that something is going on somewhere  -  and, if possible, at a point in time when the spread of the disease isnt that far advanced yet.   We must also ensure effective coordination.   Therefore, the World Health Organization is of great importance in two respects.   It must be the organisation from which we get the information and the assessment.   It can employ the help of specialists for this purpose.   There must also be the capability of triggering a chain of action for the international community.   The World Bank also plays an important role in this context.   In particular, it has established the basis for poorer countries to be able to insure themselves against pandemic risks.   This means its no longer necessary to just sit there alone with a huge burden in ones hour of need because such insurance makes it possible to put to use the chain of action that we are still building up.   For example, Japan and Germany are participating in this emergency programme.   Naturally, there are huge debates, as there always are in science: Can one be insured against pandemics? Who wants to calculate and assess the risk? How long could it take for me to ever get into such a situation? It can take a very long time for the damaging event to occur.   But it can then become very expensive once the damage has been done.   These are all wonderful topics and they are all being dealt with.   A broad field of research opens up when it involves developing effective means to prevent, diagnose and treat diseases.   In relation to potential pandemics in regions that may not have received the full focus of our attention so far, there should also be diagnostic and treatment options.   You know how long it took with the Ebola vaccination.   If it had involved measles, then perhaps we would have had it a lot sooner.   Therefore, it is also important to be fair and to create similar treatment options for the different risks in the world.   In Germany  -  which I want to mention at this point  -  we have made great efforts to attend to health research, particularly in the past few years.   I recently opened a health-research centre for neurodegenerative illnesses in Bonn.   We have created a framework programme for health research in order to be well equipped to deal with the most diverse illnesses and to be a good partner in international collaborative arrangements.   However, we see that the incentive to go into certain fields of research also has to be kindled.   In this regard, a global view is of great importance to all of us in order to concentrate not just on the diseases that we deal with in industrialised countries, but also to take into consideration other illnesses.   At this point, I would like to mention the so called neglected, often tropical, diseases that were already a topic of interest during our G7 presidency.   The research commitment for this doesnt seem to be paying off at all in some cases.   But if you consider that up to 1 billion people could be affected by such illnesses, you realise that it is a huge issue.   Therefore, I also expressly welcome an initiative that was launched at the beginning of this year  -  it was given the go ahead in Davos  -  and is called the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, abbreviated as CEPI.   This will promote the research and development of new vaccines.   Various countries, foundations and companies are participating in the initiative.   Germany is also joining this public private partnership with a contribution of 10 million euros.   Professor Hacker has already pointed out that the development of new antibiotics and antibiotic resistance are also huge issues.   We risk falling behind again in some areas because antibiotics that we had once researched no longer have the desired effect due to antimicrobial resistance.   Therefore, the topic is one of the pillars of our health commitment in the G20.   In the G7, we reached agreement that we should rely on the so called One Health approach.   That means there is just one health that applies to humans and animals in equal measure.   That is to say, we carefully examine the food products that we humans ingest, looking at how the food came about and what types of antibiotics were used on the animals that we consume.   The G20 agriculture ministers have already held a meeting and committed themselves to the goal of allowing the use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine exclusively for therapeutic purposes and no longer for the purpose of promoting animal growth.   But one must say that the definition of therapeutic purpose is an intriguing matter because the question of how much room hens and chicks have in their coops, for example, plays a part in deciding whether antibiotics must be used in order to prevent diseases, or whether one can forgo antibiotics because there is enough space for the poultry.   We should give very good consideration to how high a price we are paying when there is resistance to an antibiotic and we arent finding new antibiotics so easily.   Achieving success in antibiotic research in the pharmaceutical industry  -  I am no specialist, of course, but Ive taken a look at it; indeed, all of you here are experts  -  is like getting five numbers right, or probably six, in Lotto.   You cant plan this easily.   Success doesnt grow on trees.   This year, not only you from the science academies have met, but we also have a conference of health ministers at the G20 level for the first time in order to once again make a good professional evaluation of what you tell us here.   We have also asked the health ministers to carry out the simulation of a pandemic outbreak  -  a kind of dry run  -  for the first time and to describe action plans.   At a national level, we conduct regular training exercises for anything and everything back in our home country in order to practice how we should act in the event of a catastrophe.   But on a global level, we arent familiar with such exercises, which led to a situation in which the most efficient helpers in the fight against Ebola were military units because they were able to act with clear chains of command and clear capabilities, while the civilian structures were not prepared for it: Who will do the transporting? Who will procure the medicines? What does the chain of command look like? Who will boost hospital capacity? There were quite different approaches.   In this respect, we want to be better prepared for crisis situations.   The state and government heads are supposed to be presented with a short version  -  so to speak  -  of the simulation exercise.   Im still not quite sure how theoretical or how clear the thing will be.   I always look at my summit Sherpa quite eagerly when something is being presented to me.   But it should be the case that we, as state and government heads, are also able to understand what is being presented to us.   Because such presentations then lead to action recommendations, which we can prepare in our governments.   I really consider this topic to be extraordinarily important.   For this reason, I would like to once again sincerely thank you for facing this joint undertaking.   I hope that it was rewarding for you as well.   It certainly is for us.   Many thanks, Professor Hacker, and to your colleagues as well.   I have forgotten one other thing.   We saw how poorly things worked when handling the Ebola crisis.   We then considered what lessons were to be learned from Ebola.   We thought that was something only the United Nations could carry forward  -  the World Health Organization indeed belongs to the United Nations system.   Then three countries initially  -  Germany, Ghana and Norway  -  formulated an appeal to the UN Secretary-General to address the issue.   The UN Secretary-General then commissioned three other countries to prepare recommendations for action.   That was somewhat strange.   I said: I havent heard anything more about it because three other countries are now dealing with it.   The international community is large, but we were allowed to again bring in our experts in the second panel.   The action recommendations were then delivered to the UN Secretary-General.   After that, he named a special officer to oversee it further in cooperation with the WHO.   It finally found a way, so to speak, into the mechanism of the United Nations.   As a result, the issue was formalised and therefore has relevance at the United Nations as well.   Now they should just make sure not to lose sight of it.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on the occasion of the G20 Dialogue Forum for the Science and Research Community (S20) in Halle (Saale) on 22 March 2017",2017-05-17,"Germany","A.Merkel",3435,"en"
"18","doc73711","Ms Küppers, Ms Bschorr, Federal Minister Schwesig, Ladies and gentlemen, We are now coming to the end of the G20 Dialogue Forum with Women.   Ms Bschorr and Ms Küppers, I am of course very intrigued to see what recommendations I will be receiving later that will be incorporated at least in their substance into the negotiations for the G20 Communiqué.   This means that we should strive for unity in our negotiations with the Sherpas of the different participating countries, as decisions can only be taken by the G20 if all countries are in agreement.   That is why I would ask you as representatives from the 20 participating countries and other countries to remain active after this Womens Summit and to urge your governments to ensure that your representatives in the Sherpa meetings continue to support the womens agenda.   The motto we chose was ""Shaping an interconnected world"".   We chose this motto because the location of the G20 Summit is Hamburg which, with its harbour as an important crossroads for ships, is a good demonstration of how we are all interconnected.   And womens concerns are naturally a part of this.   Politics does not take place in a vacuum.   A very common criticism aimed at the G20 is that it only involves politicians that come together to discuss their own concerns.   That is why we place great value on the involvement of civil society.   It is for this reason that our two-day womens forum has definitely been very important.   I have already received recommendations from the Science20 Dialogue.   I will also be receiving recommendations from the Business20 Dialogue and Labour20 Dialogue.   There will also be a Youth Summit (Y20) and a Dialogue Forum with NGOs (C20).   That means that different groups of society will be able to pass on their recommendations.   I was delighted to discover just now that W20 will also be invited to L20, the Dialogue Forum with Trade Union Representatives, and to B20, the Dialogue Forum with Business Associations, so that womens concerns will be discussed not just now but also in these two other civil society forums.   These discussions will bring us one step closer to our core agenda and that is a big step forward.   In the G20, the presidencies work together as a troika, i.  e.   before Germany, China held the presidency; after us, it will be Argentina.   We took over a great deal of the Chinese agenda and we will also of course try to anticipate Argentinas agenda to ensure continuity, which is the reason why I will be travelling to Argentina before the G20 Summit.   As we are facing big challenges, we are in particular need of continuity.   We have already talked about how the political and economic participation of women does not reflect the proportion of women in society, and we will be doing so again today from a different perspective.   That is why we focused first and foremost on this topic in Brisbane in 2014.   We said that we wanted to close the gender employment gap.   Today, only 50% of women in the world are in gainful employment compared to 76% of men.   We want to close this gap by 2025.   If we look at the figures for 2014 to 2017, we can see that the number of women employed has gone up in Germany.   This has been greatly influenced by increasing child care facilities and making them more widely available.   In other countries, there is room for improvement.   We discussed the topic of entrepreneurship and we will do so again.   I can only fully support what the Minister said to us just now.   In Germany too, it is not easy for women to obtain loans or have their business models approved by bankers that are often men who sometimes cannot properly imagine such models succeeding.   That is why it is so important that women work in banks, like the Bank of Americas representative who we met yesterday, so that women are also involved in decisions on whether to grant access to financing or not.   As was already commented, tomorrow is Girls Day.   Today, a group of fifteen-year-old girls came to visit me at the Federal Chancellery.   We talked about career choices.   Every year, there is a prize for answering a specific question.   The class of the schoolgirl who answers this question correctly wins a special tour for her class.   The question this time was what percentage of those starting their studies in engineering in the 2016-17 winter semester in Germany were women.   If I had participated, I would have won.   I would have guessed 25% without knowing the answer.   It is actually 24.  7%.   Of course one of the schoolgirls won.   She guessed 23%.   Incidentally, this girl had only been in Germany for a year and a half, as she was a young Syrian refugee.   It was good to see that she got the first prize for her class after so little time.   At the Girls Day, there are always ""job trails"" where girls can learn more about technical jobs.   The D21 Initiative is a company initiative in Germany which is very involved in this.   At this job trail, I also learned a great deal about current training and education opportunities in digital technologies.   We can see in Germany that girls are traditionally steered towards certain jobs only.   That is why it is crucial that they be taught already at school to look further afield at all the jobs they could actually do.   However, first things first, i.  e.   girls first need access to a basic education.   For example, from our partnership in migration affairs with the very poor Republic of the Niger, I know how difficult it is in some countries for girls to have any access to education after the age of ten.   This has a knock-on effect on the rest of their lives, such as when they get married and how many children they have, which in turn affects population growth in the country.   That means that there is still much to be done and we must in particular support emerging economies and developing countries.   Social progress in those countries can only benefit from girls and women being more involved in the changes made.   So we have a lot to do.   We must also think about how we could best achieve rapid development.   This is particularly the case for emerging economies and developing countries because digital developments are opening doors  -  as we heard yesterday in the panels  -  to information and business models, which would not be at all accessible there without digital technology or smartphones.   This is why a main focus for us at W20 was one that we have not yet discussed here, i.  e.   ""#eSkills4Girls"".   This project aims to overcome three barriers.   First, that girls of school age be trained in digital skills.   Second, that they have clear role models  -  a crucial issue.   Third, we need innovative ideas about how to support women in the digitalised world.   In one month, on 26 May 2017, the next G7 Summit will be held in Taormina, Italy.   The G7 industrialised countries will also focus on the topic of women at their Summit.   It is very clear that even in these countries, there is still much to be done.   We are also trying to incorporate a lot of topics from the German G7 presidency into G20 to have some continuity.   That is why I hope that the G7 Summit in Italy will also contribute to the work of the G20.   I am looking forward to our discussions now and I am intrigued about what will be included in the work package I will be given.   I can promise you that I am very motivated and will do everything in my power to convince my fellow colleagues.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G20 Dialogue Forum with Women (W20) in Berlin on 26 April 2017",2017-05-17,"Germany","A.Merkel",1294,"en"
"19","doc73691","Mr Heraeus, Presidents, Representatives of business associations, Ms Hendricks, Ladies and gentlemen, The G20 has a special responsibility in global economic affairs.   After all, it makes up two-thirds of the worlds population, three-quarters of its trade and more than four-fifths of its Gross Domestic Product.   So when we agree on particular stances or approaches within the framework of the G20, it is highly relevant, you could even say of the utmost relevance, for global economic development.   The financial crisis, which began in 2007 as a property crisis and subsequently mushroomed into a global economic crisis, showed all too clearly that no country in the world is in a position to halt the domino effect of negative developments like this single-handedly, and no country by itself can effectively prevent such a crisis from recurring.   This insight helped the G20 to become established as a global cooperation platform.   Since then, we have also been meeting at the level of Heads of State and Government.   Up to that point, the G20 only included the finance ministers.   The G20 is an informal body.   It does not enact legislation or adopt regulations.   Nonetheless, the G20 may prove to be a trailblazer in finding responses to the major challenges of our times.   The first steps we took involved learning lessons from the international financial crisis.   For example, the G20 has agreed that, in future, losses in the financial market will not be compensated by taxpayers.   Banks now have much more equity capital available.   The concept of ""too big to fail"" is no longer an issue.   And there is a G20 roadmap to improve the monitoring and regulation of shadow banking.   This is a topic I consider very important, since regulating banks is not, on its own, sufficient, because it immediately leads to evasive action into the shadow banking system.   The goal was  -  and we now know how hard it is to achieve; the finance ministers are still working on it  -  to create a level playing field, i.  e.   comparable, globally applicable regulations, and to introduce regulations for every financial centre, every financial player and every product on the financial market.   We have made good progress on this.   That, of course, doesnt mean we can prevent crises completely, but the risk that a crisis on that scale will recur has been reduced.   We are also calling for transparent, fair and reliable taxation systems.   That involves implementing measures which curb attempts to reduce taxes through base erosion and profit shifting, among other things.   The transparency initiative adopted by the finance ministers within the context of the G20 is already resulting in considerable change throughout the world.   Over the years we have consistently expanded the G20 agenda.   Basically, our motivation was that after overcoming the acute crisis, we wanted to become more open towards what has recently often been referred to as inclusive growth.   That is why the issues of climate change, poverty, health, displacement and migration, and development have appeared on the agenda alongside the traditional economic and financial topics.   These are issues that concern many people.   These are issues that are playing a huge role in all societies against the backdrop of advancing globalisation.   It is a fact that the world is becoming increasingly interconnected.   That means, for example, that we know more about one another, and we are cooperating more with one another.   What one country does or doesnt do can sometimes have a very rapid impact on other countries.   This also and particularly applies to economic development.   That is why it is so important to regularly take account of global indicators in economic and growth forecasts; they include conflicts, migration, epidemics, financial market developments and economic policy decisions in very different countries.   All this involves unpredictability and uncertainties.   That raises the interesting question of how to respond.   The very existence of the G20 really means that isolation and protectionism are a dead-end rather than a way forward.   That is why I say that anyone who tries to evade international competition may hope to gain an advantage in the short term, but in the medium and longer term their own capacity for innovation will be weakened.   For new ideas and developments are most likely to thrive in an atmosphere of freedom and openness.   That is, at least, the view of the German Presidency.   With this in mind, we are working within the context of Germanys G20 Presidency to jointly create a global regulatory framework in order to tap the potential offered by globalisation and reduce the risks it presents.   To achieve this, we need strategic decisions that will ideally provide medium and long-term guidance for all stakeholders.   That is why we have chosen the motto ""Shaping an Interconnected World"".   An interconnected world should not be shaped haphazardly but needs to be designed to build resilience, improve sustainability and assume responsibility.   Prosperity through openness  -  that is what we are both willing and able to share with our partners in the world, with industrialised countries and developing nations alike.   Peoples well-being is, of course, always at the heart of what we want to achieve.   And what we are doing in the area of the economy and financial markets is not an end in itself but focuses on the interests of our citizens.   Yet simply stating our intentions is not, of course, enough.   Our words have to be followed up with action.   It is vital that we engage in dialogue on this issue within our societies.   I therefore want to thank you for having gathered since yesterday to discuss what guidelines you want to propose to us.   As economic players, of course, you are aware what obstacles can get in the way of trade and investment.   You maintain international contacts.   That makes you partners of a policy designed to shape globalisation.   Yet, looking at the entire G20 format, it goes beyond questions of economic policy.   We have established other dialogue forums in addition to the dialogue with business associations.   I have already spoken to representatives from the field of science.   There is an alliance of the national academies of science of all the G20 countries.   Last week, womens issues were on the agenda; incidentally, business issues also played a prominent role there.   One of the discussion topics was e-skills, i.  e.   the digital skills of young girls, and specifically starting out in business.   It therefore seems that you have forged a connection with the womens forum, which I very much welcome.   You came together yesterday and have gathered again today.   Your session will be followed by meetings of the unions, the non-governmental organisations and the young people.   We have placed great value on a broad-based civil-society process in order to examine various perspectives, but also to emphasise that the G20 is not some kind of elitist political event, but makes use of knowledge and skills from various areas of society.   Ties are not only formed at political level, but also among business associations, womens associations, unions and other groups.   Mr Heraeus, I offer you and the many others who have assisted you my sincere thanks for your dedication.   I am quite sure that we will benefit from the insights you have gleaned.   We will try to incorporate these findings into our communiqué and our activities.   Now, you are aware that we have 20 different countries with 20 political systems, in some cases very different, with 20 very divergent levels of development, but everything has to be agreed on unanimously.   That is not an easy task.   The so called sherpa process  -  as you can imagine  -  poses a considerable challenge.   It is almost easier to herd cats than to keep the people here together.   But I can also say that there is a high level of common will because ultimately all players know that shaping globalisation is possible.   I am very glad that you from B20, as business representatives, have clearly expressed your support for open markets and a multilateral trade system.   Again and again we encounter issues which we thought had already been decided, but where year after year we have to struggle to regain the previous years level.   Of course, certain vanities are also cultivated.   In the G20 we work together as a troika.   Our predecessor is China.   We enjoyed wonderful cooperation with China, and we continue to work well with China today.   Argentina will take over from us.   When you have devoted passion and energy to formulating statements on climate protection or on trade in the past year, you dont, of course, want to abandon them if in the next year different ones are to be composed, which means that keeping what has been attained is sometimes an achievement in itself.   I dont want to go into any more detail now.   Be that as it may, I am grateful for your support of open markets and a multilateral trade system.   However, it has to be said, particularly with regard to a multilateral trade system  -  the WTO also takes part in the G20 meetings  -  that although the G20 format came into existence as the result of a crisis, we have seen an increase in protectionist measures in recent years.   These are not necessarily tariff-based barriers, they can also be non-tariff barriers.   Mr Azevêdo, Director General of the World Trade Organization, knows a thing or two about inventions that, when it boils down to it, are nothing more than trade barriers.   With regard to globalisation, we are now increasingly having to wrestle with the issue that while its all well and good that global prosperity overall is growing, the question remains who is actually benefiting from this growing prosperity.   That brings the topic of inclusive growth onto the agenda.   It means that we also need to be more effective in integrating economically weaker countries into the international division of labour.   We need to find incentives to boost economic activity in the countries and regions in which it is not yet so well developed.   In this area particularly, the international organisations, the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the International Labour Organization are very helpful in submitting proposals to us based on their own perspective.   I have met with the heads of these international organisations regularly each year since 2007  -  then it was still the G8 Presidency, which we held for the first time that year.   We can safely say that the cooperation between these international organisations, including the OECD  -  which I forgot to mention just now  -  has intensified considerably, and that these institutions also provide important input for our work in the G20.   We can see the impact that better integration into the global economy can have when we look at the Millennium Development Goal from 2000 of halving extreme poverty rates by 2015.   On average, this goal has been achieved.   That is above all due to the economic upswing in Asia.   The deadline for the Millennium Development Goals has passed.   Now we have the 2030 Agenda, which takes a different approach that I approve of: it focuses on every country, regardless of whether they are industrialised countries, developing nations or emerging economies.   The goal is economic development and sustainability.   In addition, we have the multilateral Paris Climate Agreement, which sets down a binding process to maintain an upper limit for global warming of two degrees, ideally 1.  5 degrees.   In my view, both agreements represent a major achievement for global politics.   But now the time is coming where we have to implement these obligations.   To do this, we need business, too, to do its part.   Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful that you are embracing this responsibility.   The title of your dialogue forum: ""Resilience, Responsibility, Responsiveness  -  Towards a Future-oriented, Sustainable World Economy"" shows that these are the very issues you are focusing on.   Enterprises are well positioned to assume responsibility and to be guided by the principles of sustainability and inclusive growth.   I think it is perfectly legitimate, I would even say helpful, to highlight this  -  regardless of whether we are talking about issues of climate protection and resource efficiency, fair supply chains or investment in countries that are in particularly urgent need of it.   As we have seen that with some Millennium Development Goals, where they have been achieved, this success has been chiefly due to the very dynamic development that Asia has experienced, in contrast to Africa, we have committed ourselves to making the Partnership for Africa a top priority of our Presidency.   We want to strengthen economic cooperation with our neighbouring continent.   Now the task is basically to find a way of moving away from providing traditional development assistance to generating real economic momentum.   These two areas have always been treated quite separately in the past.   On the one hand we have traditional development assistance, which has not necessarily led to a self-sustaining upswing.   On the other hand we also understand, when we see the African Unions Agenda 2063 that we need to think much more in development categories.   In this area, we can also learn from the emerging economies.   For example, I am following with keen interest Chinas approach towards the Asian Development Bank, for example, as China, itself coming from great poverty, has gone through a development process and knows what is important.   For instance, transnational infrastructure projects are often crucial to improving mobility also within a country.   Countries in Africa need to have better access to ports.   Electricity is another vital factor, of course.   When we look at the level of electrification in many African states 50 or 60 years after independence, we realise that the first thing we need to do is not to talk about building up medium-sized enterprises but to discuss the conditions that need to be met before businesses are even able to settle there.   Having said that  -  the environment minister is here  -  today it is possible to skip entire development phases that we as industrialised countries passed through  -  with regard to energy supply, for example  -  because the sun in Africa is much more readily available than it is here and because solar energy has become much cheaper than we could have envisaged ten or fifteen years ago.   We need to ensure that countries do not again go through all development stages, but instead take advantage of new opportunities from the start.   Skipping development stages is also possible as a result of the spread of digital technology.   It is interesting to note that many young people in Africa first encounter electricity via the solar cell of their smartphone.   That is also how they know how other people in the world live.   It gives them totally new perspectives on the world.   That is another reason why the issue of digital technology needs to feature on the G20 agenda.   Under Germanys Presidency we have had a meeting of Digital Affairs Ministers for the first time.   I believe this has been the right response.   In the forum on womens issues, too, we discussed in great depth the subject of womens access to digital technology, which, like the major topic of access to education, is of crucial importance.   Ladies and gentlemen, that is why we have decided  -  and this goes for many federal ministries; it also plays a central role in the finance ministers process with Wolfgang Schäuble  -  to develop a Compact with Africa.   The emphasis is on Compact, and, of course, Africa, but the preposition is also important.   It is ""with"", not ""for"".   That reflects the shift of focus.   We want to cooperate with African countries and have already selected an initial group.   We intend to discuss development projects with these countries, which will also take on ownership, responsibility for these projects, and we will then help them to set down the framework conditions, including loans and other tools, that they need to be able to implement the projects.   So it wont be an ex-cathedra approach  -  we tell you whats good for you  -  but a joint task.   I believe this is the right approach.   Of course, we need to ensure that in industrial development we also take into consideration sustainability factors, i.  e.   resource efficiency and climate protection.   In this context, renewable energies are crucial in their competition with fossil fuels.   The G20 states have considerable responsibility, given that they emit approximately three-quarters of global greenhouse gases.   That is why it is important that we have a forum through which we can organise a regulated transition to a lower-carbon economy and learn from one another.   We are not the only ones who are talking about this.   Last weekend I visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.   There, stakeholders are well aware that they need to go down a path that will allow the economy to prosper even in times when fossil fuels will no longer play a central role.   Ladies and gentlemen, investment in the sphere of energy policy and resource protection will pave the way for a low-carbon era.   We have to show  -  and this was the problem in developing a global climate agreement  -  that resource efficiency, reduction of greenhouse gases and economic development are not mutually exclusive.   The poorer countries, the developing nations, understandably also want to have the chance of development.   It is therefore only right that the highly developed industrialised countries do their part to make new technologies marketable.   In this context, the Renewable Energy Sources Act surcharge, which isnt very popular with some German businesses, ultimately also contributes to the development of many other countries, enabling them to benefit from new technologies.   Ladies and gentlemen, I could go on to list many other aspects of our G20 Presidency.   I would like to say a few words on the subject of business and health, which Mr Heraeus mentioned.   Recommendations on the subject of health will be forthcoming.   We very deliberately included the topic of health on the agenda.   Without health, development is inconceivable.   With this in mind, we have also put the fight against antimicrobial resistance and neglected tropical diseases on our agenda.   Our approach to tackling pandemics is something else I consider particularly important.   We will be holding a meeting of the G20 health ministers for the first time.   The health ministers will consider the question of what we have learned from the Ebola crisis.   Together with the World Bank and the World Health Organization, they will conduct an initial, theoretical pandemic exercise.   We have talked about this in detail, because an epidemic that can spread so quickly from one place in the world can also affect the entire global economy.   We need to have clear plans on how to respond.   We need to have specific insurance or other solutions in place for countries at risk so that they do not immediately descend into chaos.   A great deal for the whole world hinges on what happens if I concede that a pandemic could develop in my country, but first and foremost a lot, of course, is at stake for the country affected.   If the country is afraid that if it admits to the problem, it could slide down into economic chaos for the next five to ten years, it will remain silent.   That is why we need to develop safety nets so that countries are willing to notify the World Health Organization of any cases and we can respond quickly before any further damage is caused.   So that is another of our topics.   Thank you very much for coming here.   Thank you very much for the work you have done for us.   I would like to say to you on behalf of Mr Röller, our sherpa, and the entire sherpa staff, as well as in my own name, that we will do everything we can to incorporate as much as possible of what you say to us and what we then deem to be right  -  I dont think there are too many disparities  -  into our agenda.   Thank you once again to all those who have contributed, and thank you for coming to Berlin.   You have helped us to effectively shape the G20 process in Germany for the summit in Hamburg.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G20 dialogue forum with business associations (B20) in Berlin on 3 May 2017",2017-05-18,"Germany","A.Merkel",3351,"en"
"20","doc73681","Ladies and gentlemen, Hermann Gröhe, Colleagues of Hermann Gröhe from the G20 states and partner countries, Director General Margaret Chan, Representatives of international organisations, I, too, would like to extend to you a warm welcome.   To be honest, this is the only ministerial meeting I am participating in as Chancellor  -  perhaps also because it is the first meeting of the health ministers.   I would therefore also like to bid you a very warm welcome myself.   As the host of this years G20 meeting in the Federal Republic of Germany, we have chosen Hamburg as the location for the gathering of the Heads of State and Government.   The symbol you can see here everywhere is a maritime symbol, which is very appropriate for the port city of Hamburg.   It is a reef knot, which grows tighter the more you pull on it; only then does it fully develop its connecting quality.   Our slogan is: ""Shaping an interconnected world"".   Firstly, I would like to thank China.   China hosted the last G20 meeting.   During that session we laid the foundations for todays meeting by anchoring the topic of international health in the communiqué of the Heads of State and Government for the first time.   I would like to begin with a request to Argentina, because Argentina will be hosting the next G20 conference.   We hope that the topic of health will not be forgotten but remain as prominent as it is at the moment.   I think that, in an interconnected world, this subject deserves a place on the G20 agenda.   Why? It is a humanitarian issue: everyone should be able to depend on a functioning healthcare system.   To this end we urgently need better cooperation  -  particularly in the case of infectious diseases, of course.   These diseases do not stop at national borders.   Growing global mobility is increasing the probability that such diseases will spread.   Particularly aggressive pathogens can pose a global threat, also to economic cycles.   The President of the World Bank, Kim, repeatedly points out that if the Spanish flu at the start of the 20th century  -  it was extremely aggressive and spread very rapidly  -  were to break out again today, we would probably not be adequately prepared for it.   In view of the wide range of interdependent issues, the spectrum of G20 topics has broadened in recent years.   That, too, is a logical consequence of globalisation.   In any case, Gross Domestic Product is not in itself sufficient to describe the inclusive growth on which we really need to be focusing.   I think it makes both economic and social sense to join forces to tackle global challenges.   The starting point was the disastrous impact of the Ebola crisis just a few years ago.   Many people provided help.   But the help came very late, it was slow, it was uncoordinated.   It would be very cynical not to learn any lessons from an event like this.   Then people would say it was a serious failure on the part of politicians.   When another disease of this nature broke out, if not before, people would ask: Did we do enough to prevent this? In the past few days we have heard of new cases of Ebola in the Congo.   That is why, more than two years ago, within the context of the replenishment conference of Gavi  -  The Vaccine Alliance, I listed the deficits that the Ebola epidemic revealed to us.   Since then, we have embarked on a great deal together.   Reform proposals were submitted by the United Nations High Level Commission, among others.   The measures elaborated by this panel formed the basis of a report to the Secretary General of the United Nations and, in turn, formed the basis of many reform processes currently under way.   That concerns, firstly, our responsiveness in the case of health crises.   To this end we have initiated changes at the level of the United Nations.   The World Health Organization has set to work to develop clearly defined emergency structures  -  and I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Director General for this.   This is very important and welcome.   They now need to be implemented to ensure that we are able to act.   I myself have visited the World Health Organization.   I know that a Director General can only be as good as the degree to which the member states she has in her ""ensemble"" so to speak are willing to cooperate.   To be honest, that is no easy task, for the individual regional organisations enjoy a high level of independence.   I therefore want to express my heartfelt thanks to Margaret Chan for using her powers of persuasion to considerably improve the accountability of the WHO leadership and the regional organisations to one another and for the fact that cooperation is now much better.   Just think: if there is the threat of the outbreak of a pandemic in a region, for example in Liberia and other African countries, every country knows what that means for the reputation of the entire region  -  and it is often very poor countries that are affected.   So of course on the one hand there is the temptation not to say anything about it, because it could have devastating economic consequences.   On the other hand people know that not talking about things doesnt improve matters.   I think that what has now been created in the WHO  -  a coordinated procedure in the event of a crisis  -  will play a crucial role.   But that also depends on assistance being made available at a central point  -  that means: personnel, material and funds.   In exchange, we as member states of course also expect transparency and accountability regarding how the resources have been invested.   That is very important.   So firstly, we need rapid responsiveness.   Secondly, we need a coordinated procedure, with the World Health Organization playing a central role.   Thirdly, we need new mechanisms for quick financial assistance.   In that area we have achieved something: we have the Contingency Fund for Emergencies, the CFE, at the World Health Organization, and the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility, the PEF, which has been launched by the World Bank.   The CFE has already demonstrated its ability to function.   Funds have already been used to fight local outbreaks of disease.   However, the funds financial resources still leave something to be desired.    -  Health Minister Hermann Gröhe is nodding.   So anyone who becomes convinced during this conference that greater resources are needed is warmly invited to contribute.   The same goes for the PEF, which is due to be launched this summer.   We are going down a very interesting path there.   Can states insure themselves against the risk of epidemics? That would mean they would then not have to appeal for help but could, in the event of a crisis, fall back on their insurance instead of being forced into the role of supplicant.   Now I know that raises a lot of theoretical questions  -  the World Bank can tell a tale or two about that, too: Is it possible to assess how great the risk of a pandemic outbreak is in one of more than 190 countries, and how high would the insurance have to be? Nonetheless, I believe it makes sense to examine these questions in order to then provide real security for affected countries.   Ideally, of course, the insurance would not be needed.   That is why we need, fourthly, strong healthcare systems.   Margaret Chan and Hermann Gröhe have talked about this aspect.   As G20 states, we have a responsibility to work on this in our own countries as well as to provide support for those nations which are not yet themselves in a position to improve their healthcare systems.   For it is in the interests of us all that certain diseases do not spread in the first place or can at least be identified at an early stage.   That is why the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is so important, citing the right to universal healthcare as one of its 17 goals.   That in turn goes hand in hand with economic issues.   The engagement for strong healthcare systems generates new jobs and employment.   People remain in good health for longer.   They can participate in the work process more reliably.   Investment in healthcare systems also means investment in economic systems and improves the prospects of all countries, particularly the emerging economies and developing countries.   In order to make process with regard to the 2030 Agenda goal, we need to coordinate our activities as closely as possible.   We therefore need to agree on a basic outline of what exactly is necessary at grassroots level, what existing structures ought to be developed, how treatment and medication can remain affordable for people and how to better organise training for medical personnel.   I believe that the paper ""Healthy Systems for Universal Health Coverage"" provides a good response to this and a good basis for developing a joint understanding of how we should proceed.   I would like to thank all those who have worked with us on fleshing out this paper.   In this context I would particularly like to thank the WHO, the World Bank and Japan, as well as all the German staff, of course.   I invite all of you to get involved in the Universal Health Coverage Partnership.   Good cooperation between industrialised and developing countries is also vital for the research and development of new means and methods of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases.   The industrialised countries have a special responsibility for medical advancement.   They have the research capacity that poorer countries lack.   That is my fifth and final point.   The CEPI initiative has been in place since the beginning of the year.   This stands for ""Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations"".   It is a coalition of public and private partners, including individual states and the European Union as well as foundations and enterprises.   Of course it will take time for new medicines or vaccines to be distributed.   The initiative also needs more funds.   But I think in principle we are going in the right direction.   I really want to convey to all those involved my heartfelt thanks for their tireless commitment  -  above all our colleagues from Norway and India at this point.   I encourage all those considering whether to participate to get involved.   Every contribution helps.   You see we are sticking to the principle: ""There is no free lunch in this world.  "" You are constantly being asked to take part in something.   But its for a good cause.   The fight against antimicrobial resistance depends, among other things, on the research into and development of new agents  -  the second point, which the previous speakers already mentioned.   The development of new antibiotics  -  as Margaret Chan just explained very effectively, is on the one hand an arduous and cost intensive undertaking, but it is also urgently needed.   That is why it is all the more important that we closely coordinate our activities in this area.   We need to do more so that the substances we have remain effective in the future.   To this end we need a responsible approach to antibiotics to prevent resistance from spreading more quickly and aggressively than it does already.   I trust that in their communiqué the health ministers will give us, the Heads of State and Government, a clear mandate.   The interesting thing is that this applies both to human medicine and to agriculture.   The interdependence between humans, animals and nature is quite evident.   That is why the G20 agriculture ministers agreed on an action plan at the beginning of the year.   We consider this a very positive achievement.   We want to build on it.   For I believe that if we make progress on these issues, we will also promote acceptance of the G20 process in civil society, because people will realise that we are working on behalf of their health and their lives.   Health is in any case an interministerial topic.   That is also reflected in our civil society dialogue forums.   I have already received many helpful recommendations on health issues from the Dialogue Forum for the Science and Research Community, in which our countries national academies are cooperating.   Only yesterday a G20 business event on health took place.   Ladies and gentlemen, will we live up to our responsibility for global health? Have we done enough? You as health ministers have found your own way of getting closer to the answer.   Im almost a little bit sad that I cant be there to see it, because you plan to perform a simulation.   Im very interested to see what the outcome is.   I hope this will allow us to visualise the issue in such a way that we can then present it to the Heads of State and Government to see where we stand and what still needs to be done.   The results of this simulation will interest us as much as the results of your discussion.   I therefore wish you an intensive exchange and hope you gain good results and useful experiences in the practical exercises.   I have read that anyone who wants to can visit the Reichstag this evening and enjoy the view over Berlin.   That is something else I can recommend.   We usually sit down below and look up into the dome.   You will probably be able to look down today from the dome and see where we give our speeches.   Be that as it may, welcome to Berlin and to Germany! All the very best, and enjoy your stay.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the G20 Health Ministers meeting in Berlin on 19 May 2017",2017-05-26,"Germany","A.Merkel",2240,"en"
"21","doc73671","Mr Hoffmann, Ms Burrow, Representatives of the international trade union associations and trade unions in the G20 member countries, Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that you are meeting here today at the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung and that you also already worked on the topic yesterday.   As this years G20 host, it is very important to us to include as wide a range of civil society as possible in the preparations.   We believe that our entire discussion with the political representatives of the G20 will be greatly enhanced as a result.   We believe that we will also receive recommendations from you.   We believe that the results of your work will be included in our talks so that those who represent the billions of workers in the G20 will also be at the table in spirit.   And we believe that we cannot simply dismiss your concerns, but rather must include you in our talks.   Naturally, the G7 and the G20 are different formats.   But we believe that harmonised demands can also emerge in the G20  -  in this case among the unions  -  even if the various member countries have very different living conditions and political systems.   As trade unions, you incorporate a group that also knows how important it is to stand united if one wants to achieve certain demands.   By now we also know  -  after all, this was how the G20 came about in the first place  -  that events in one country can end up affecting all of us around the world.   We have learned that developments are closely interconnected and know that working together makes us stronger.   As you know, our summit will be held in Hamburg.   We decided to use a maritime knot as a symbol, and we chose the reef knot.   The more you pull it, the tighter it becomes  -  that is what is so nice about this particular knot.   We believe that our interconnected world must stand firmly united when different forces tug at the knot.   I see the President of the National Council of German Womens Organisations.   I am pleased that the unions have taken on board what we discussed at the Dialogue Forum with Women and working with womens representatives.   In the same way that there is a wide-ranging social partnership between business and the unions in Germany, employees also face many issues that affect women in particular.   That is why each dialogue forum with civil society results in an independent network of interests  -  and that is a good thing.   Naturally, your focus is on work  -  working conditions and opportunities.   After all, many fundamental issues are linked to work.   Do I earn enough to feed my family? Is it possible to live up to what my employer expects of me? Might digital technology, modernisation or innovation make my job superfluous? Do I even have a job? And a very important topic  -  what about environmental and safety regulations? That is why the G20 has always strived for constant and ideally sustainable growth.   Inclusive growth is also becoming an increasingly important topic in political discourse.   That is good and as it should be.   After all, as I said earlier, the G20 only came about in the first place at the level of Heads of State and Government as a result of a crisis, that is, the international financial market and economic crisis Mr Hoffmann mentioned.   It taught us that we can only overcome the problems by working together.   Although this crisis mainly started in the United States and the Anglo-Saxon financial area, everyone got involved in tackling it in the end  -  and that was the right thing to do.   That is why we fundamentally reject isolationism.   We believe that we can shape globalisation together, but we are also firmly convinced that shaping globalisation is about people and that the opportunities available to them  -  and not only profits on the financial markets or individual gain  -  must be improved.   We chose the motto ""shaping an interconnected world"".   Global supply chains are one issue in this, and a topic we have already addressed in the G7.   They are an excellent example of how the world is interconnected.   According to estimates by the International Labour Organization  -  Mr Ryder of the ILO was already here with you  -  some 450 million jobs are directly or at least indirectly derived from global supply and value chains.   Starting with the sourcing of raw materials, a primary product passes through many workers hands in various countries before it becomes a saleable product.   As a result, those who curtail or even sever such value chains and put their faith in isolationism and protectionism harm all those involved.   There is currently a very interesting discussion in political negotiations on what protectionism actually is.   We always use this term in a particular way.   But what does it mean? Where do we need to protect ourselves and look for reciprocity? We cannot have a situation where some countries commit to complete openness, while others isolate themselves.   That means we need to look for opportunities to achieve comprehensive and rules-based trade facilitation  -  ideally within the framework of multilateral agreements.   However, we also have to recognise that there is now a large number of bilateral agreements.   We know that small and medium-sized enterprises in particular find it difficult to gain any sort of foothold on global markets, partly because there are very different regulations.   I say this in particular as regards firms in developing and newly industrialising countries.   These firms often face significant trade barriers.   For example, at todays cabinet meeting we spoke about African countries that are experiencing moderate growth.   In a fairer world, they would find our European markets more accessible than is currently the case.   On the other hand, we know that unemployment is also high in Europe.   Before we dismantle trade barriers, we also need to talk at home about how much we need to protect ourselves and our workers.   It is often difficult to find a fair balance here.   Discussion on the EU-Canada trade agreement was also very intense in Germany.   As a result, we realised that modern trade agreements need to mean more than dismantling trade barriers and must include social, environmental and consumer standards.   We also want to have dispute settlement bodies that are transparent and capable of resolving disputes in a way that people can understand.   Of course, this brings us to a point that is much more difficult as regards the G20  -  the fact that some countries are highly developed and have very high standards, while others are still struggling to achieve minimum standards.   How can we say what are appropriate working conditions in the various countries of the world? It is not easy to answer that question.   There are many differences between the G20 countries in particular.   If we are serious about implementing Article 1 of Germanys Basic Law, then it does not only make sense to foster humane working conditions all over the world  -  it is essential to do so.   That is why we actively support the implementation of international frameworks, such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, on which we have drawn up a National Action Plan in Germany.   We also want to play our part in fostering humane working conditions along the entire international supply chain.   In the G7, we dealt in depth with Bangladesh and the terrible conditions faced by female textile workers.   Our response was to set up the Vision Zero Fund to call in the funding pledged by various countries to improve occupational health and safety.   Even in the G7 context, that is no easy task  -  and it is almost embarrassing sometimes how lightly some promises are made and how difficult it then proves to implement them.   We are now continuing the efforts to fill this fund in our G20 Presidency.   We also support mechanisms that make it possible or easier for workers to file complaints about bad working conditions.   In many cases, we do not know exactly what the conditions are like.   However, transparency is very important here.   Whether or not a job can be seen as a good job naturally also depends on what it pays.   I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the many private-sector collective bargaining initiatives along supply chains.   I can say that we have had positive experiences in Germany with collective bargaining.   Firstly, politicians do not have to get involved in everything.   That is already an advantage.   Secondly, talks can sometimes become very heated, but our experience is that shared responsibility develops, in part because the employees side also has to decide what is important to them.   For example, they have to ask themselves if training is also important and what is important to them as regards training young people.   They also have to ask themselves if they are only thinking about todays employees or if the future also matters to them.   Collective agreements have become far more comprehensive in recent years as a result.   Particularly during the crisis in the eurozone, we saw that the unions willingness to take on responsibility was not something one can take for granted everywhere the way we can in Germany.   Of course, a major problem for the unions is how to help people who are out of work and integrate them into the labour market.   We know that education and training are becoming increasingly important.   In Germany, we have a dual system of vocational training.   However, we constantly need to improve this system.   You can do a masters degree free of charge in Germany, but you have to pay to become a master tradesperson, even if you receive financial support from the state.   Whether or not that is actually fair is a topic that all parties are, I think, now looking at more closely.   We also need to offer vocational training  -  and not only university degrees  -  in new types of jobs in the digital sector, as the practical approach of the dual system of vocational training is, and will remain, very important.   We have a special task in Germany  -  to integrate the many refugees who have come here into the labour market.   We are thinking here both of integration in the host country and the possible need for reintegration in the countries of origin, for example when IS has been defeated in Iraq or peace has been restored in Syria and new situations develop as a result.   We regard integration as a key component.   And this also involves education  -  both language and vocational training.   We are also focusing on improving opportunities for women on the labour market.   The G20 set a specific goal for the first time in Brisbane, that is, to reduce the gap between male and female employment by 25 percent by 2025.   This also affects the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in which womens situation plays a key role.   We held the G20 Dialogue Forum with Women three weeks ago.   On the second day of this event, the women said that they had been invited to take part in the Business 20 and Labour 20 discussions.   I was very pleased to hear that.   One of the things we said at that dialogue forum was that we want to improve access to loans for female entrepreneurs in developing countries in particular  -  we are currently working with the World Bank on a fund for this  -  and that we need to enhance womens digital literacy.   The first step is for women to be interested in this topic.   But then there needs to be access to digital training.   Ladies and gentlemen, all of you are far more involved in the reality of problems in working life than I am.   That is why we said we would not only have two speeches here  -  one by Mr Hoffmann to me and one by me to you  -  but also hold a discussion.   In the final analysis, what is at stake is a good life all over the world.   We in Germany feel a responsibility not to live at others expense.   We see ourselves as part of a shared world in which there can only be peace if we take everyones situation into account.   That is why I am eager to hear your recommendations.   I am looking forward to hearing your views and to our discussion.   Thank you very much for inviting me here and thank you very much for your work.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G20 Dialogue Forum with Trade Unions (Labour 20) in Berlin on 17 May 2017",2017-05-30,"Germany","A.Merkel",2066,"en"
"22","doc73661","Prime Minister, Distinguished colleagues, Barbara Hendricks, Ladies and gentlemen, Allow me to start by saying a few words on what happened last night.   Ive been following the reports from Manchester with great sadness and shock.   Its incomprehensible that someone could take advantage of a cheerful pop concert to kill or seriously injure so many people  -  so many young people.   Id like to convey my sincere condolences to all victims and those affected by this tragedy, as well as to their families in their grief and despair.   This suspected terrorist attack will merely strengthen our determination to continue working together with our friends from the UK to combat those who plan and carry out such despicable acts.   People in the UK can rest assured that Germany stands shoulder to shoulder with them.   Ladies and gentlemen, let us observe a minute of silence to remember the victims of this tragic event.    -  Thank you.   Prime Minister, Barbara Hendricks, Ladies and gentlemen, As in previous years, weve gathered here in Berlin to prepare the next UN Climate Change Conference, the 23rd of its kind.    -  Naturally, Im delighted that the OECD Secretary-General is with us today.   He has presented us with a report on which Ill say something in a minute.    -  In contrast to previous years, the Climate Change Conference itself will also take place in Germany, namely in Bonn.   However, the Presidency will be held by another country, the Republic of Fiji  -  thus allowing us to enter into unchartered territory, as it were.   Id therefore like to extend an especially warm welcome to all our guests from the other side of the globe.   I greet you with a cordial ""Bula"" which  -  so Ive been told  -  means ""welcome"" in Fiji.   With Germany and the Republic of Fiji, we have two countries working together which lie far apart in geographical terms.   However, were united by our shared conviction and will to contain the impact of climate change as much as we can.   It has to be said that were looking at global warming from very different perspectives.   Climate change poses a much more direct threat to a country made up of more than 300 islands and located in the tropical climate of the South Pacific.   Germany, by contrast, lies in the heart of Europe in a moderate climate zone.   As a highly developed industrialised country, we are responsible for relatively high CO 2 emissions.   Naturally, we thus bear considerable responsibility for ensuring a change of direction.   Im sure we all agree that the international community made a historic decision when it adopted the Paris Agreement.   We undertook to keep global warming under 2°C and to limit it to 1.  5°C if possible.   The latter goal in particular, namely limiting global warming to 1.  5°C, was of great importance to the island states.   For every rise in temperature means a rise in sea levels.   Today's paradises are at risk of disappearing.   It was therefore vitally important that the international climate agreement was adopted and could enter into force quickly.   Of the 197 signatory states, around 150 have now ratified it.   As of 18 May 2017, 146 states had done so.   Decisions are right and important.   However, now we have to rise to the challenge; now the right steps have to follow.   The Conference of the Parties in Marrakech last year sent a clear message: we want to advance along the path we have embarked upon.   Moreover, a schedule was adopted for making the decisions made in Paris more concrete and fostering initiatives.   The key question remains as to how we can guarantee that all states make, and are indeed able to make, their national contributions towards reducing greenhouse gases.   Its clear that industrialised nations and larger emerging economies have to lead the way.   Developing countries must be given support  -  whether it be financial or technological assistance.   Thats why Germany joined forces with Morocco, the host country of the last UN Climate Conference, to establish the NDC Partnership.   Just under 60 states have now joined.   At the UN Conference in Bonn, the focus will be on drafting a detailed instrument on implementing the Paris Agreement.   For example, we need uniform standards so that national reduction targets and reporting on them really are comparable; in my view, this is an extremely important issue.   This will also engender transparency and a solid basis for ensuring that states trust each other and engage in genuine exchange.   Our plan is to make enough progress in Bonn so that we can then make the necessary decisions at the UN Conference in Poland in 2018.   Moreover, we want to prepare for the facilitative dialogue next year.   It will help all states to review their targets.   Its also a trial run for the global stocktake in 2023.   Furthermore, the Presidency of the Republic of Fiji will draw attention to the states hit hardest by climate change.   Given their situation, swift action is essential.   This isnt merely a case of time is money  -  this is truly a question of survival.   We need to keep reminding ourselves of that.   Half of Germanys international climate-related funding is being channelled into adaptation to the climate change already taking place, with a view to supporting other countries.   During our G7 Presidency two years ago, we launched an initiative to create insurance policies for developing countries hit especially hard by climate change.   We would now like to expand this project into a global partnership during our G20 Presidency.   Much would be achieved if the various governments were to all pull in the same direction.   It goes without saying that wed be fighting a losing battle if we were to act alone.   We always need many stakeholders on board.   Thats why local councils, NGOs and companies are invited to the Climate Conference in Bonn.   They will present a wide variety of approaches and measures to climate change mitigation in an effort to learn from each other and also to find others beyond their own circles prepared to follow in their footsteps.   For its clear that we need a global alliance of all states in which, whats more, all sections of society are included.   This is about a comprehensive transformation towards the most sustainable possible lifestyle  -  in social, ecological and economic terms.   Thats why the Paris Agreement is closely linked with the 2030 Agenda.   Our revised German Sustainable Development Strategy includes the global goals for sustainable development.   Our aim is to look at the economy, the environment and social issues together and to take interdependences into account in our decisions.   These decisions range from the purchase of everyday goods to long-term private and public investment  -  whether, for example, they concern the modernisation of infrastructure or the transformation of energy systems.   The OECD  -  and Id like to express my thanks to Mr Gurría and his staff  -  has drawn up a study on ""Growth, Investment and the Low-Carbon Transition"".   According to this document, we will have to increase investment in sustainable infrastructure  -  transport, energy, telecommunications  -  by roughly ten percent around the world in the next 15 years if we are to meet the two-degree target.   The OECD believes that this extra expenditure can be recouped.   For using more efficient technologies will save costs.   Of course, cost avoidance due to fewer burdens resulting from climate change also has to be taken into account.   The OECD has even come to the conclusion that we could achieve more growth through a common climate policy for all G20 states.   In Germany, weve already seen that prosperity and sustainability can indeed go hand in hand.   This is demonstrated, among other things, by a wide range of efficiency technologies which have made many of our companies leaders on the global market.   Nevertheless, this is about huge sums which have to be found before they can be redirected towards sustainable investment.   The state level alone will quickly reach its limits.   Thats why we need more private investment.   The more companies take part in this, the quicker well advance towards better climate protection.   The energy transition in Germany shows that despite the great effort involved, advancing along this path is worthwhile.   Once a start has been made, once the breakthrough of a new technology has been achieved, then costs go down.   Thats an important lesson.   The technological know-how gained can then benefit poorer countries which still lack their own research and development capacities.   There have already been palbable results: the price of energy generated from renewable energies has fallen considerably around the world.   The United Arab Emirates is one example.   Solar installations have been built there which produce energy for three US cents per kilowatt-hour.   Theres a similar situation in Morocco with regard to wind farms.   In Germany, were relying more and more on tenders when it comes to promoting renewable energies.   In the case of photovoltaic systems, costs are starting to fall further.   The first round of bids for off-shore wind farms far surpassed our expectations.   Some bids dont even require promotion.   When I think back to how we supported the first ten gigawatts, then I realise how much leeway we have.   We can now say that around one third of the energy consumed in Germany is generated from renewable energies.   Despite their rapid expansion, the security of supply continues to be guaranteed.   However, theres no denying that we still have a few challenges to master.   For instance, we have more possibilities to generate energy than we have to store or transport it.   That means that the bottleneck in Germany is no longer due to power generation but quite clearly due to the question as to how we get the energy to where its needed and how to better store it.   Those who succeed in future in finding ways to store energy will have a broad range of uses for their know-how.   Of course, we not only need progress in the energy sector but also in all other spheres  -  for example, buildings or transport.   The spread of digital technology opens up new opportunities.   Connected mobility in local and long-distance public transport, car sharing, autonomous vehicles  -  all of this can foster sustainable mobility.   Smart electricity meters help consumers to better monitor and control their power consumption.   The ecological and economic benefits of these new technologies are evident: consumers use less energy and resources and save money.   This creates substantial market opportunities for providers.   However, I dont want to paint too rosy a picture.   It takes considerable effort to put any innovation into practice, even in a highly developed country like Germany.   In the case of smart electricity meters, people wonder: what does the electricity company know about me; what about data protection? We have questions on insulation, about which weve been discussing promotion instruments for a very long time but have never been successful across the board.   However, progress has been made  -  sometimes slowly, sometimes a bit quicker.   I can therefore only encourage everyone to embark upon this path.   The development of renewable energies continues to advance around the world.   There is good news to report from many countries.   Id like to give you just a few examples.   China is the worlds biggest investor in the development of renewable energies.   India recently decided to construct another 50 solar farms.   This has brought the country closer to its target of generating 175 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2022.   Kenya is currently building a wind farm with 365 wind turbines, which can cover up to 20 percent of Kenyas energy requirements.   It has now been possible to give two thirds of the population access to electricity.   When I look at the number of African countries where access to energy is under 25 percent, then I realise that solar and wind energy presents us with a huge opportunity to generate electricity on a decentralised basis and thus enable many people to have access to electricity for the first time.   Of course, Im especially happy about the situation in Kenya.   For during Germanys G7 Presidency we advocated the active promotion of the development of renewable energies in Africa.   In the G20, too, were now focusing more on Africa.   We want to mobilise more private investment within that forum, with a view to fostering sustainable development.   However, its difficult to mobilise investment without any electricity.   Its therefore important this goes hand in hand.   Even though advances in technology have considerably reduced the cost of developing renewable energies and even though electricity generated with renewable energies is cheaper than electricity generated from fossil fuels in many countries, starting capital is always needed to advance renewable energies, as well as climate-friendly investment in general.   Donor countries, financial institutions, development banks and private stakeholders therefore have to play their part.   Private stakeholders in particular do of course need planning certainty for their investment.   Thats why long-term strategies are so important, as called for in the Paris Agreement.   For they can provide orientation for investors and, ideally, the maximum level of openness to new technologies.   A total of six states have now adopted their long-term strategies and submitted them to the United Nations.   They include the African state Benin.   Germany is also among these countries.   With our Climate Action Plan weve set out the next stage until 2050: a reduction of at least 55 percent in greenhouse gases by 2030 and 80 to 95 percent by 2050.   However, we still have much to discuss with regard to the details of this Climate Action Plan.   Were being careful to tackle these goals without exclusively focusing on specific technologies and in a cost-efficient way.   The whole thing is an ongoing process, thats to say there are regular adjustments.   Here, too  -  as in the drafting of the Climate Action Plan  -  we have to ensure that the largest possible number of stakeholders are involved.   The European Union also has a concrete target: by 2030 it aims to have reduced emissions by at least 40% compared with 1990 levels.   Every member state must play its part.   A key instrument here is emissions trading, which we want to strengthen.   Parallel to this, we mustnt of course forget our economys competitiveness.   For theres no point if production is simply transferred to other parts of the world.   Emissions damage the climate  -  regardless of where they are produced.   I can therefore only welcome Chinas decision to launch its national emissions trading before the end of the year.   Then, as it were, well have two major regions  -  the European Union and China  -  trying out this market economy instrument.   Of course, it would be best if the production of harmful greenhouse gases were to have a global price tag.   A global carbon market would create incentives for the most efficient possible production and at the same time prevent distortions of competition.   Thats why we launched a platform during Germanys G7 Presidency two years ago to enable us to work together more closely.   This is another issue which could be expanded to include the G20.   Ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe  -  as does my Government  -  that there are no excuses; protecting the climate concerns us all.   Firstly, we all feel the impact of climate change.   Secondly, progress in protecting the climate will benefit us all.   Were responsible for each other.   Were liable for each others actions.   We are bound together by a common fate.   As the Summit will take place in Hamburg, we chose a maritime symbol  -  a reef knot  -  for our G20 Presidency.   A reef knot grows tighter the more you pull on it, the greater the strain placed on it.   Our motto is: ""Shaping an interconnected world"".   We cannot deny that our world is interconnected, nor can we call this into question.   We are bound together by a common fate.   The spirit which reigned at the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement must also be present today  -  as its implemented in Europe, in the G7 and G20 states and at the United Nations.   Im still trying to persuade the doubters.   Theres always work to be done.   But for now Id like to thank you very much for your attention.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the VIIIth Petersberg Climate Dialogue",2017-06-01,"Germany","A.Merkel",2698,"en"
"23","doc73651","Messrs Presidents, Prime Minister Gentiloni, my friend Paolo, Distinguished representatives of international organisations, G20 nations and partner countries, My honoured fellow Cabinet members Wolfgang Schäuble and Gerd Müller, Ladies and gentlemen, Some of you have travelled a very long way to be here today.   So let me wish you all a very warm welcome to this partnership conference entitled ""investing in a common future"".   We hope that this conference will help ensure that these are not just nice words on paper.   We really want to work during this conference to put cooperation into practice.   Our economic relations form an ever closer-knit web around the globe.   Thanks to the Internet, we now know more about each other than ever before.   Distance has lost its import when it comes to making new contacts and maintaining them.   Developments like these of course bring tremendous opportunities.   However, they also mean that we have to work towards sustainable and inclusive economic development for the entire world.   A single country acting alone cannot make much headway on such a project.   Yet globalisation is not a destiny to which we must yield without demur.   On the contrary, it is something we must forge in partnership with others.   The Agenda 2030 is a great achievement, because all the countries on our planet have agreed on a common pathway for development.   In contrast to the Millennium Development Goals, which defined targets for the developing countries, this time all countries  -  developed and developing nations alike  -  are part of this Agenda 2030.   It is on this basis that we have adopted the motto, ""shaping an interconnected world"", for our G20 Presidency.   The G20 Summit will take place in Hamburg.   We have chosen a maritime image  -  a reef knot  -  as the symbol of our Presidency.   The harder you pull on it, the better it holds.   It symbolises the ties between our countries.   We know that pan-global development can only succeed if all continents share in such development.   This also means, first and foremost, that the African continent has to make progress on its development pathway over the next few years.   Even today, the economies of some African countries are remarkably dynamic.   Some are even growing faster than the industrialised and newly industrialised economies of the G20.   Success stories like those should inspire others.   They reveal the potential that lies in African countries  -  for example in the field of renewable energy and digital development.   There are many good examples of decentralised energy supply and much more besides.   But much still remains to be done.   We in the industrialised countries have to consider whether we have always taken the right path in providing our traditional development aid.   I dont think we have.   We have to focus more strongly on each specific countrys own economic development.   Thats what gave rise to the idea  -  proposed first and foremost by our Finance Minister and our Development Minister  -  of saying we need an initiative through which we dont speak about Africa, but speak with Africa.   The result was the G20 Compact with Africa Initiative.   The countries of Africa have also set their own targets in their Agenda 2063 and have clearly stated what they believe development should bring.   Thats why its called the Compact with Africa, not the Compact for Africa.   The idea is for each country to say what development steps it considers necessary and how it thinks we can help and how, together, we can make available suitable instruments, so that the relevant development projects do succeed.   You will talk about this in more detail today and tomorrow.   We want to lend support for regional market integration, not least in order to enhance the transfer of technology and know-how.   We also want to ensure that trade flows between Europe and African countries really benefit everyone.   We still have a lot to do in this regard.   The next European Union-African Union summit will take place in November.   Todays meeting, which we are hosting as part of our G20 Presidency, will also serve to prepare the ground for that summit.   We are aware that our achievements of the past years are not yet enough.   In many countries, development lags behind what is needed given the speed of population growth.   Africas population is expected to double by 2050.   We also know that development is only possible if security is given.   However, in many parts of Africa security is not yet sufficiently guaranteed  -  be it due to fragile sovereignty, conflicts, terrorism or humanitarian crises.   Numerous human tragedies are being played out as we speak.   For this reason, boosting the economy does not top the agenda in some African countries.   They need to deal with day-to-day survival first.   As a result, the G20 Africa Partnership is concerned on the one hand with economic development, but on the other with fostering peace, stability and security  -  i.  e.   in creating the basic conditions for economic activity.   There, too, we have to learn to think anew.   For many years development policy-makers did not pay sufficient attention to security issues.   For many years, we felt virtuous when we were not dealing with military equipment.   But some of you have said to me that you are expected to combat terrorism, but are not given any support to do so.   I thus think we have to be more honest and admit that only where security is given can development take root.   I consider it very courageous of some countries to take responsibility upon themselves in the fight against terrorism in Mali and its neighbourhood.   France now wants a Security Council mandate in this connection.   I can only say that Germany will support this.   Special attention will have to be devoted to the youth of Africa  -  as highlighted in the Agenda 2063.   More than half of all Africans are under 25 years old.   As I keep saying in Germany, the average age here in Germany is 43 years.   The average age in Niger, Mali and other countries is less than 15 years.   This just goes to show the very different situations we have to deal with.   If we dont give young people prospects for the future, if we dont invest in education and skills, if we dont strengthen the position of girls and young women, the development agenda will not succeed.   In other words, as part of our work in the G20 we will do everything we can, through the compacts with African countries and through special initiatives for womens education and female entrepreneurship, to improve the prerequisites that should enable Africa to develop and grow as we need it to.   If hopelessness is too widespread in Africa, young people are also more likely to seek a better life elsewhere in the world.   Thus, by working together with you for your countries, we are also enhancing our own security and will be able to put a stop to the activities of criminals who are toying with refugees and migrants fates and extracting large sums of money from them.   Many refugees have terrible tales to tell of human smuggling and trafficking in human beings.   States thus have to work together.   We have to create legal options for movement and must not permit people to make money from the suffering of others.   Ladies and gentlemen, this conference also serves to draw attention to the differences between your countries, to the diversity of challenges faced in Africa.   For this reason, too, let me thank you for coming.   Many people in Germany are not yet as well informed about either the good or the difficult aspects of life in your countries as we would wish.   Getting to know each other better, learning more about each other, and assuming responsibility together are all also aspects of shaping an interconnected world.   I hope that this conference will make a contribution to this end.   And so let me ask all of you here today not to mince your words, to talk ""tacheles"", as we say in Germany.   Simply saying nice things doesnt achieve anything.   We have to learn from one another.   And we need results.   Thats what were here for.   A very warm welcome to you all.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the “G20 Africa Partnership – investing in a common future” conference on 12 June 2017 in Berlin",2017-06-15,"Germany","A.Merkel",1359,"en"
"24","doc73641","Dear representatives of the City of Hamburg, Dear hosts, Mr Bornhorst, Mr Stolper, Representatives of international non governmental organisations, Ladies and gentlemen, Ive been very much looking forward to our discussion.   This event focusing on civil society is the only one that I am attending in Hamburg.   All of the others were held in Berlin.   The G20 Summit is just around the corner.   In a little over two weeks, the summit participants will be meeting here in Hamburg.   I think that, especially when the international environment is particularly challenging, like it is this year, we should seize the opportunity to establish common interests and achieve progress through joint action.   That is always a better approach than for individual nations to try and go it alone.   Thats what we should bear in mind as we meet, even though I do believe the talks will be difficult.   Im sure youll agree with me on that.   This G20 Summit will be a true challenge for its organisers, for security officers and, last but not least, for the city and people of Hamburg.   We know that.   That is why I want to state explicitly that I am grateful that so many people are working hard to make this a constructive, good and secure event.   I know that many also criticise the political agenda of such a summit.   From a democratic standpoint  -  and I want to underscore this  -  thats a good thing.   Of course, the right to express peaceful criticism is protected by the Basic Law.   Yet I want to re emphasise that this criticism should be peaceful.   So thats what I wanted to say about what lies ahead.   You can applaud  -  its not forbidden.   Maybe clapping will also help cool everyone down a bit on this very warm day.   Now, Im truly looking forward to our discussion.   Because when civil society shows commitment, this generates debate, and this is always beneficial in the end.   Thats what makes democratic culture vibrant.   During the last two days, you have made an important contribution in this regard.   I want to thank you for that right now, before you hand me your official conclusions.   Recently, we have in too many countries witnessed a tendency towards self isolation and hampering critical dialogue.   In some cases, weve even seen attempts to prevent or suppress such dialogue.   As a result, the freedoms of expression and of the press are stifled.   There are also negative impacts on cultural diversity and, ultimately, on the ability of all of civil society to shape the future.   So I would like to say this quite clearly: When the rule of law is not respected, we cannot look the other way.   Freedom of expression is a basic right, and it is laid down in Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   Of course, it is also protected by our Basic Law.   We must not tire of repeating how only a free society can guarantee prosperity in the long term.   We are campaigning for this idea during our G20 Presidency, which we have held for a few months now.   Our discussion here shows, as does the entire dialogue process that is being conducted with businesses, science, unions, women and youth, that this always involves lively debate.   There is much we can learn from such debate that will be of use for the G20.   Of course, there are also discussions going on between the sherpas at G20 level  -  that is, between the official government representatives who are closely following our issues all the way up to the summit.   Theyll need to prepare themselves for what will certainly be a very difficult last night of negotiations right before the summit meeting.   The representatives of German NGOs, too, have had the opportunity to state their views during meetings of the sherpas.   I can tell you that the dialogue process has already created important impetus on the issues, and this should inform our discussions at the level of Heads of State and Government.   At the G20, questions concerning the global economy always take centre stage.   The focus is no longer, as was common earlier, simply on growth, but rather more about sustainable and inclusive growth.   Globalisation is a process that can benefit anyone who approaches it with an open mind.   That at least is how I view globalisation.   There are countless examples.   For instance, in Asia, opening up economies to global trade has successfully reduced poverty.   Also, the Millennium Development Goal of reducing the number of people living in extreme poverty by half was achieved.   We did not achieve this goal in Africa, but we did reach it thanks to developments in Asia.   The G20 must therefore highlight the advantages of trade being intensive, international and fair  -  in contrast to protectionist policies.   If you interfere with the establishment of, or even sever, global value chains, all you do is harm everyone involved  -  including yourself.   We have already taken a close look at global value chains in the G7  -  because they are not automatically a good thing, but rather require optimisation with respect to their stages.   Quite a lot has therefore been achieved in the G7.   Working on them in the G20 is of course much more difficult.   We believe this means that we can create new prospects if we support the multilateral system of the World Trade Organization.   This multilateral trading system is based on common rules.   Having common rules means we should work to establish standards for protecting workers and consumers, as well as the climate and the environment.   This applies to the G20 countries, as well as to all partner countries and to all production sites.   We must do this if we want to address the problem of global value chains.   We have a particular interest in better integrating women into economic processes and corporate functions.   The aim here is to give women more opportunities to participate in economic development, which in turn will increase acceptance for globalisation.   Furthermore, this will increase acceptance of fora such as the G20.   After all, many are concerned that all of these issues are not being addressed in this context.   However, considering the fact that global connectivity is constantly on the rise, I think the work of such fora is more important than ever.   One thing is clear: globalisation is not a destiny to which we must yield without demur.   Globalisation can be shaped.   The key thing is that we must coordinate our efforts.   When we work toward common aims, everyone benefits.   Thats why Germany is working to strengthen international cooperation.   Weve also expressed this idea through the logo of our G20 Presidency.   We chose the square knot not only because it refers to the maritime heritage of Hamburg, but also because it is particularly effective and strong when you pull on it with greater force.   What we need to do is pool various interests, so that we can find answers to the big questions of our time.   One of these is protecting the climate.   The aim is to as rapidly as possible reduce the carbon emissions of our economies.   The Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will guide us along the way.   I believe this is true more than ever now that the United States has announced it is leaving the Paris Agreement.   Another very significant current global development is the digital revolution.   We are talking about the effect that digital technology is having on our lives, our economies and our work.   We are also discussing how we can increase participation at global level in the digital revolution, what we can do to protect privacy and intellectual property, and how we can ensure cyber security.   To prepare for this G20 Summit, we also held a meeting of Digital Ministers.   Although these are still early days, I am convinced that global rules need to be found for this domain, as well, and that it is not enough for each country to create its own.   I think the EU has taken an important step and has pointed the way with its General Data Protection Regulation.   We have put another issue on the agenda that I feel very strongly about.   We want to look at how we can do a better job of reducing health risks that can create tremendous human suffering and stunt the economies of entire regions.   This will involve strengthening health care systems and the global health architecture.   It will also mean taking action on antimicrobial resistance.   At the summit, we will examine the outcome of the first G20 Health Ministers meeting.   This meeting of the G20 Health Ministers explored the idea of an international system to respond to the threat of emerging pandemics.   This is a very interesting issue, and we must strengthen multilateral organisations, specifically the World Health Organization and the World Bank, in this connection.   Another strong focus of our Presidency is promoting development in Africa.   Only one week ago, the G20 Africa Conference was held in Berlin.   We can see that the population of Africa  -  at least large sections of it  -  is not yet participating to a sufficient extent in global developments.   So we looked at how we can stimulate more private investment  -  not instead of, but in addition to, development aid.   I have read your communiqué.   During our discussion, we will certainly have the opportunity to discuss the concerns you have expressed.   However, I firmly believe  -  considering that today, more than half a century after the end of colonial rule, a mere 20 or 25 percent of the population in so many African countries have access to electricity  -  that we cannot expect these places to experience economic growth.   We cannot expect these to be good locations for expanding small and medium sized enterprises.   For this reason, we must enable private investment.   To us, it was very important to think about this.   Thats why we placed the G20 Compact with Africa  -  please note the ""with"", not ""for""  -  on the agenda.   I am very pleased that the African Union, with its Agenda 2063, has for the first time ever drawn up its own development plan.   It can serve as a point of reference for our own efforts, so that we do not patronise Africa by proposing projects it does not even consider important.   All in all, we want the Hamburg Summit to send a signal that we can, as a group, think on a global scale and take global action, so that everyone stands to benefit.   Regarding economics and the regulation of financial markets, which are our actual key focuses, we will work to counteract any tendencies to weaken financial market regulations.   Concerning regulation of shadow banking, we have an ambitious agenda to work through.   This is a very important topic.   We will not lose sight of it.   The message, in a nutshell, is: First, the G20 is assuming responsibility for life here and now  -  through its partnership with Africa, by tackling the causes of displacement, by fighting terrorism and corruption, and with constant efforts to achieve food security and development.   Second, the G20 is also assuming responsibility for the world of tomorrow and beyond  -  by pursuing climate protection, by implementing the ever so important 2030 Agenda, and by shaping digitalisation and strengthening global health.   All of this is easy to say  -  but much harder to do.   There is strong opposition, and there are great expectations.   Often, progress is slow and tedious.   At times, we need someone to show us the way.   That is why I am very grateful that we are backed up by a strong civil society.   At times, they express constructive opposition and force us to think.   Yet I believe that we agree on the overarching aims, and that we all are convinced that globalisation can be shaped in a humane way, so that it does not lead to greater injustice and inequality.   Thats what I wanted to say as a lead in to our discussion.   Now, Im looking forward to talking with you.   Please do test me on the convictions Ive expressed.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G20 Dialogue Forum with Non Governmental Organisations (C20) in Hamburg on 19 June 2017",2017-06-23,"Germany","A.Merkel",2018,"en"
"25","doc73631","Federal President, Esteemed Presidents, Honoured guests, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, We are gathered here today to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the start of the Reformation.   We recall the pugnacious Augustinian monk Martin Luthers decision to publish his views in 95 Theses.   Martin Luther appealed to the conscience of many people  -  people who until then perhaps lacked their own courage or their own words for expressing their doubts and apprehensions about the dogmatic rules in place at the time.   We do not know with absolute certainty whether the nailing of the 95 Theses to the door of All Saints Church in Wittenberg on 31 October 1517 actually took place in precisely the way that has been handed down to us in the history books.   However, what is certain is that, with his Theses, Martin Luther set a ball rolling that was unstoppable and which was to change the world forever.   Whether politics and law, language and social affairs, art and culture, hardly any area of life was spared the Reformation triggered by Martin Luther  -  and far beyond the borders of Germany and Europe.   It is therefore not for nothing that the Reformation is also called a true ""citizen of the world"".   However, the Reformation was, at first, primarily a movement of religious renewal that aimed to achieve a fundamental reordering of the humankinds relationship with God, with itself and with our fellow human beings.   The liberating message that mankind can solely find salvation before God by grace and through faith alone took centre stage.   Mankind cannot buy Gods mercy nor attain it by good works, rather it is given as a gift to those who believe.   With this belief, the Reformers considered themselves to be free from the paternalism of church authorities and, by extension, also secular hierarchies.   And so an understanding of humans emerged that was to have a profound impact on the modern era  -  the concept of emancipated humans called unto liberty, assuming responsibility for themselves and for others.   This is wonderfully expressed by the song that we sang today  -  ""Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott"" (A mighty fortress is our God)  -  which was composed by Luther and based on Psalm 46.   Its core message  -  God should and can be our fortress  -  is the reason why it became the stirring anthem of the Protestant movement and was hailed by Heinrich Heine as ""the Marseillaise of the Reformation"" in 1834.   Every democratic order is essentially based on this understanding of humanity.   Even though, of course, no straight line can be drawn from the Reformation to democracy and to a constitutional state as we know it today, the Reformation and the notion of freedom on which it is based proved to be a driving force in the ongoing process of social and political renewal.   It is therefore important to keep its intellectual, cultural and religious heritage alive  -  not least because the Reformation, taking faith as its starting point, offers important impetus for shaping social coexistence in the 21st century.   It is precisely for this reason that it is so vital to seize this anniversary as an opportunity to engage in an intensive debate on the Reformation in society.   The great number and diversity of the events taking place throughout the country, which have met with most keen interest, continue to give expression to this.   They were and continue to be impressive.   Permit me to thank everyone who has played a part here, often with great passion.   One event that occupies a special place in my memory is the service of reconciliation in Hildesheim  -  a wonderful symbol of ecumenism, irrespective of everything that continues to divide Catholics and Protestants today.   Thank you once again for the cross that you presented today.   The Federal Government has also supported a wide range of cultural and educational projects together with churches, the Länder, municipalities and countless civil society actors.   Our involvement in the preparations and implementation of the Reformation anniversary celebrations was and continues to be an expression of our efforts, beyond this anniversary, to facilitate a rich and lively religious community in Germany in general.   The freedom of religion and faith as well as the unhindered right to practise religion for all believers and every religious community are protected under our Basic Law.   Just as the freedom of religion must always be protected against religious fanaticism, the freedom of religion also requires religions to be protected against efforts to play them down.   I consider the cause of religious freedom  -  both here in Germany and around the world  -  to be a common task facing politicians and churches.   This in no way contradicts our separation of politics and the state that is necessary in accordance with our concept of the state; on the contrary, even though our country is, without any doubt, committed to religious and ideological neutrality, politicians may not under any circumstances dispense with their responsibility to protect and preserve a shared foundation of values that is vital for thriving and peaceful coexistence  -  both within a country and between nations.   Our country is committed to the universal task of respecting and protecting human dignity.   This is the basis of our duty to respect and protect religious freedom, alongside other liberties enshrined in our Basic Law.   People of different faiths and ideologies live and work in Germany.   The fact that they encounter each other with tolerance, are there for one another and assume responsibility for their communities is an essential precondition for ensuring that society as a whole develops for the better  -  and that means supporting the cohesion of our society.   That may sound almost banal, but it is not.   Rather it is the result of a learning process that has gone on for centuries and which has sometimes been very painful.   We have not forgotten that the Reformation did not herald the dawn of an era of peace and freedom  -  the root of our identity  -  but that it was first followed by a long story of conflict in the course of which the wars of religion inflicted terrible suffering on Europe.   At the same time, these conflicts also made it necessary to seek viable, i.  e.   humane, solutions and regulatory approaches to enable the coexistence of the various different faiths.   The Reformation therefore gave rise, indirectly, to the perception that questions of faith needed to be legal relationships guaranteed by the state within the framework of a secular order.   We know that the discovery of the freedom of Christians in the Reformation was not initially a question of the freedom of religion, a concept that the Reformers did not accept at all.   It was inconceivable for them for different notions of faith and truth to exist alongside each other.   The Reformers remained firmly rooted in the Middle Ages in this respect.   Luthers raging against those who thought and believed differently, especially against the Jews, is a clear yet shameful testament to this.   I therefore very much welcome the fact that the commemoration of the Reformation has also encouraged a historical examination of this issue.   It is vital to call to mind this centuries-old learning process when talking today about the importance of tolerance in our open societies, in our globalised world.   Those who preach diversity must practice tolerance.   That is what our continents historical experience teaches us.   The fact that tolerance is the basis for peaceful coexistence in Europe was learned the hard way.   We have thus learned that tolerance is the soul of Europe.   It is the basic principle of every open society.   There can be no open societies without tolerance.   Acknowledging plurality and dealing with differences and religious and cultural diversity are a key challenge in our globalised world.   After all, we are witnessing today that wherever religious freedom is in bad shape, social development as a whole is jeopardised.   History therefore teaches us how important it is always to view religious freedom and tolerance as two sides of the same coin.   In concrete terms, this means even when religious convictions contradict ones own standpoint, it is important to remember that they are of vital importance to others.   We must therefore ensure that everyone is able to live in accordance with their religious beliefs without having to fear discrimination.   However  -  and this must be just as clear  -  this can only work when we act on the basis of generally accepted rules that are mutually applicable to all.   Put very simply, tolerance reaches its limits wherever our liberal values and human rights guaranteed by our Basic Law are disregarded, or even trampled underfoot.   It goes without saying that politicians have a great responsibility for instilling a common awareness of our basic values and norms.   Churches also have a vitally important role to play in this regard.   With their message of hope for humanity, they are able to sharpen our focus for the things that unite us  -  particularly beyond religious borders.   We often know too little about each other, however.   And a lack of knowledge can, all too easily, give rise to prejudice and resentment.   This is why opportunities for exchange and contacts are so important for an interfaith dialogue.   This interfaith dialogue can be successful if we affirm our own belief in order to encounter other religions even more self-confidently on this basis.   Religious education can help to serve this purpose, and the many events in this Reformation anniversary year and in the years previously have helped to serve this purpose especially the German Protestant Kirchentag in the spring of this year.   Religious education  -  be it in the family, religious instruction or in theology studies  -  is a common task.   It is one faced by churches and religious communities, governments and educational institutions, as well as by the media and civil society.   Religious education was also one of the fundamental aims of the Reformation.   It was Luthers translation of the Bible and the development of a uniform written German language that made Holy Scripture comprehensible to the population at large in the first place.   Thanks to the invention and spread of the printing press, people were suddenly able to understand the key elements of the faith.   In keeping with the notion of the priesthood of all believers, each Christian was able and had a duty to be responsible and capable of making sound judgements in their spiritual lives and when talking about their faith.   This concept gave rise to a new social responsibility for education.   Education was recognised as an important basis for all areas of life above and beyond theological issues.   Philip Melanchthon, that great scholar and colleague of Luther, summed this up as follows in his famous pronouncement: ""When you see to it that your youth is brought up properly, it will help you to defend your cities; for no bulwark or city walls are stronger than citizens endowed with learning, prudence, and the other virtues.  "" This gave rise to an unprecedented educational awakening, which was also spurred by the invention of the printing press.   Sections of the population for whom this was hitherto inconceivable enjoyed access to education from now on.   Entirely new perspectives for personal and social development opened up.   Equal opportunities, education for all and the value of education for the public good are now, also today, the subject of public discussions and are of paramount importance.   This starts with children in kindergartens and schools.   Every boy and every girl should be given opportunities, regardless of their social or family background.   In order to learn and develop skills, some children must be given slightly more support than others  -  when sufficient encouragement from their parents is not forthcoming, for instance.   It is also important to integrate children from refugee families who have often experienced and gone through terrible things.   After school, young people have to consider which course of vocational or tertiary education to take, and ultimately, options for further and advanced training.   This is not just about good courses and facilities at these institutions, but is also a question of flexibility, so that it is possible to complete vocational qualifications after a course of studies or vice versa.   Promoting education has always been a major priority for the church.   For the church, too, this means being open to new developments that not least digital progress entails, and for which promoting independent thought and critical powers of judgement are required.   What we are experiencing today with digitisation is just as much a breakthrough as the invention of the printing press in Luthers day.   In the face of the almost infinite range of information available, many people are experiencing a growing desire for direction, for support  -  some have also expressed the desire to close themselves off from the world or to limit themselves to a very restricted number of sources of information.   As there is a risk here of perceiving the world only through an extremely selective lens, learning how to programme and operate computers and how to hold your own professionally in Smart Factories or being au fait with Smart Homes is not enough.   We must also teach media skills.   This is about nothing less than ensuring that each and every one of us learns from as early an age as possible how to cope with this abundance of information sources, and how to distinguish between things that are important and the things that are less important, as well as between serious and non-serious content.   It is precisely this that, once again, reflects our understanding of emancipated humans called unto liberty.   ""A Christian is an utterly free man, lord of all, subject to none.   A Christian is an utterly dutiful man, servant of all, subject to all.  "" Thus begins Luthers tract On the Freedom of the Christian.   While both statements may appear paradoxical at first sight, the principle that unites both of Luthers pronouncements is most convincing.   It is the principle that each and every individual has the right to free development of their personality and always has an obligation to take responsibility for themselves and others.   That is freedom in responsibility.   It is an indispensable standard for our actions.   Freedom in responsibility does not make us trust blindly that others will step up to the plate and tend to the public good.   Freedom in responsibility challenges us to contribute our own ideas, creativity and energy.   Freedom in responsibility is the basis for ensuring that our society is fair.   In all of this, let us not forget that humans are always imperfect in all that they do.   We make mistakes.   However, I find the knowledge that we arent destined to crumble as a result of our imperfection, because God bestows his grace and love upon us, to be most liberating.   He grants us mercy and love in our daily and ongoing efforts to promote what keeps us together and sustains us.   The rule of law, the freedom of religion and the freedom of opinion are precious and give us strength.   They must be filled with life day by day.   They can be filled with life day by day.   The attitude espoused by the Reformers encourages us to see that the future is open and to take our responsibility seriously.   Change for the better is possible.   And so I am grateful for the amazing opportunity that this Reformation anniversary presents to strengthen our Christian roots in our social conscience.   This task will remain also after the Reformation year and this today's anniversary, perhaps even more so than was the case in the past.   We should call this to mind at the latest when, in the Christmas period, we sing ""Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her"" (From Heaven Above to Earth I Come), Luthers song with its 15 verses.   Thank you very much.","Speech given by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel in Lutherstadt Wittenberg on 31 October 2017 on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the Reformation",2017-11-10,"Germany","A.Merkel",2619,"en"
"26","doc73621","Mr Chairman, Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr President  -  Emmanuel Macron, Ministers, guests, Excellencies, I would like to welcome all of you to Bonn and thus to the Federal Republic of Germany.   We are very proud that the seat of the UNFCCC Secretariat is here in Bonn.   We are meeting here because we are facing a  -  if not the  -  key challenge for humanity.   Climate change  -  everyone here in this room is aware of this, but I say it to everyone else, too  -  will determine the fate of our world.   It will determine the well being of us all.   In very concrete terms, it will determine whether people will still be able to live on the Pacific islands, for example, in the future, so the fact that the Republic of Fiji, an island state, has taken on the Presidency of COP23 has a particular resonance.   It is an honour for us in Germany to support the Republic of Fiji in this role  -  I say that on behalf of the entire German Government.   Our joint message is that we want to protect our world.   That is why we are committed to the Paris Climate Agreement.   That is why  -  and this is our job now after the great achievement of reaching this Agreement in the first place  -  we now need to put it into practice together.   We need the right regulatory framework to do so.   This conference is working on that in order to create trust and reliability in the joint endeavours to achieve the urgently needed progress in climate protection.   The aim is that the Talanoa dialogue will help in this regard.   We in Europe are aware of our responsibility.   The European target  -  the European Unions target  -  of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent by 2030 compared with 1990 is being implemented in the European Union through legislation.   Each European Union Member State must play its part here.   For Europe, this means that we need to draw up the necessary regulations, for example on emissions trading.   We reached an important agreement on this last week.   This instrument is based on the European Unions target.   First and foremost, certificates will be taken off the market so that prices can become an effective incentive.   The European Union Member States have reached consensus on what each of them needs to do to achieve this joint target.   They all know what contribution they have to make.   Germany set out its medium and long term strategy in its Climate Action Plan 2050.   By the mid century, our aim is to have largely achieved greenhouse gas neutrality and to have reduced CO2 emissions by between 80 and 95 percent.   The next step is to draw up concrete measures for this strategy.   I want to state very clearly here that this is not easy in Germany either.   We have set ourselves targets for 2020, 2030 and now for 2050.   Our target for 2020 is ambitious, namely to reduce emissions by 40 percent compared with 1990.   Now, at the end of 2017, we know that we are still a long way off achieving that.   This issue plays a key role in the current talks on forming a new government.   On the one hand, it involves reaching the target we have set ourselves  -  but on the other hand, it also involves social issues and jobs, for example as regards the question of reducing coal emissions.   And it involves cost factors, that is, the affordability of energy.   I just want to tell you that even in a wealthy country like Germany there are of course significant conflicts in society that we need to resolve reasonably and reliably.   The discussions are tough.   We know that Germany, as a country that still uses large amounts of coal, particularly lignite, naturally needs to play a major part in achieving the targets.   But how exactly we do this is something we need to discuss in detail during the coming days.   During Germanys Presidency of the G7 in 2015, we reiterated our joint willingness to move towards decarbonisation as industrialised countries.   I firmly believe that the industrialised countries need to play a very special and major role because they have the capacity to develop the necessary technological innovations that could set standards, but of course also because they have a historical responsibility and have been a significant factor in the rise of CO2 emissions worldwide.   During our Presidency of the G20 this year, we agreed the G20 Hamburg Climate and Energy Action Plan for Growth, that is, for more sustainable economic growth.   The OECD has also made clear what is needed  -  only if we ensure that the substantial investments are climate friendly will we be able to safeguard our future prosperity.   We thus firmly believe that climate policy is also forward looking economic policy, as preserving the basis of our existence is the prerequisite for a successful economy.   In view of this, a broad alliance comprised of a large number of states, cities and companies has also been set up in the United States and has presented Americas Pledge.   I very much welcome this because it underlines the importance of climate protection in large parts of the United States irrespective of President Trumps decision to leave the Paris Agreement.   All of this is taking place in the firm belief that the transformation to a low carbon economy  -  if carried out in the right way  -  creates great opportunities for growth.   Renewable energies, efficient technologies that save on resources and costs, climate friendly innovations in buildings and transport, and other things will become increasingly important on the markets worldwide.   Allow me to say that renewable energies already provide the greatest share of Germanys energy supply and that we are witnessing support for them increasing at a relatively fast rate and renewables reaching the market ever more rapidly.   Naturally, innovation opportunities should benefit as many countries as possible in the world, particularly poorer countries.   That is why Germany, along with the other industrialised countries, remains committed to the pledge to support developing countries by providing 100 billion dollars in public and private sector capital per year from 2020.   That is also why we in Germany are planning to double public sector climate funding by 2020.   However, private sector investments are also needed in addition to investments by the state.   It is incumbent on all of us to create suitable conditions in order to ensure that private sector capital for climate finance is truly mobilised.   Development banks and the World Bank naturally play an important role in this area.   As Member States, all of us should strengthen this role.   I can thus only welcome the fact that President Macron, along with the Secretary General of the United Nations and the President of the World Bank, will hold a summit on climate finance in Paris on 12 December.   All of us know that 12 December is a very special and magical date for Paris and climate protection.   That is another reason why this conference should be a success.   At the conference here in Bonn, the focus is on the imminent risks and on adapting to climate change.   On the one hand, we have melting glaciers, rising sea levels and flooding; on the other, we have storms, unbearable heat and severe droughts.   No one  -  I say no one  -  may or can ignore this.   And if we also think about the growing global population, we know that increasing conflicts on natural resources will be inevitable if we do nothing to protect the climate.   That is why Germany has always called for a far greater focus in the Security Council and other forums on the security aspects of climate change.   Germany will remain committed to this.   In 2016, Germany provided 1.  4 billion euros to help developing countries adapt to the effects of climate change that can no longer be prevented.   We are providing a further 100 million euros to the Adaptation Fund this year so that we can help the least developed countries with this difficult task.   I am pleased that we set up a global partnership with the World Bank yesterday for climate risk insurance in developing countries as a joint initiative by the G20 and countries particularly affected by climate change.   This agreement reflects two things: on the one hand, the fact that insurance solutions can be a reliable, lasting and good option for absorbing risks; on the other hand, it is important to us that we have agreed this partnership with the countries involved as we need to work together as equal partners and to share our experiences with one another.   More good news is that the Nationally Determined Contributions Partnership launched by Morocco and Germany has now grown to include over 70 countries.   Ladies and gentlemen, two years ago, we achieved something that we could not have imagined in Copenhagen.   However, we know that the Paris Agreement is a starting point.   We also know that we will not be able to adhere to the 2°C or 1.  5°C target with the current national commitments.   That is why each and every contribution is incredibly important.   That is why it is important that we show each other transparently that we are making our contributions comparable.   That is why this conference must send a message that we are serious as regards seeing the Paris Agreement as a starting point and that the work has only just started.   The daily weather events and climate disasters in the world show us how urgent this matter is.   That is why we now need to practise what we preach.   We in Germany will endeavour to do so, even if this gives rise to heated discussions.   And that is why I am not being flippant when I tell others to do something.   I know how hard it is to achieve this in ones own country.   For this reason, I wish all those here who work to protect the climate  -  be it as a representative of their country or a member of a non governmental organisation active in this field  -  great courage, willingness and energy.   Thank you.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at COP23 in Bonn on 15 November 2017",2017-11-16,"Germany","A.Merkel",1664,"en"
"27","doc73611","Professor Schwab, Colleagues, Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be back in Davos  -  in a very special situation this year, but I will get back to that later.   Today, when Europe is very much the focus of the discussions at this Davos Forum, I would like to recall that the First World War ended 100 years ago, in 1918.   It is described as the seminal catastrophe of the 20th century.   Worse catastrophes followed it.   Like sleepwalkers, the politicians of the time blundered into a terrible situation.   Today, 100 years later, when there are fewer and fewer surviving eyewitnesses to the Second World War, we need to ask ourselves if we have really learned from history or not.   I think the generations of people born after the Second World War will need to prove whether they have really learned something.   The lessons of the Second World War led to the foundation of the United Nations.   This was a multilateral response, a response founded on cooperation.   Over 25 years ago, we experienced the end of the Cold War and of the division of the world into two blocs.   This meant that for the first time, multilateralism and cooperation had an opportunity to thrive.   There was a multilateral response aimed at resolving the great challenge of 2007 and 2008, the international financial crisis.   This response took the form of meetings between the Heads of State and Government of the G20, whose Presidency is held by Argentina this year.   Germany held the Presidency last year and the motto of our Presidency was ""shaping an interconnected world"".   We tried to foster global cooperation in what is not a particularly easy time.   We made progress in global cooperation in the health sector, the partnership with Africa and the global steel forum, which addresses dumping and fair trade.   We tried to strengthen the role of multilateral organisations and sought to promote an open global trade system.   As regards the great challenge to humankind, climate change, we had to draw our conclusions without the United States of America, unfortunately.   Nevertheless, climate change remains a huge threat.   We see that national egoism exists.   We see that populism exists.   We see that a polarising atmosphere prevails in many countries.   Perhaps there is also widespread concern about whether multilateral cooperation is really capable of solving peoples problems honestly and fairly and whether everyone can be included given the great technological challenges of the Digital Revolution and disruptive changes.   There are doubts about this everywhere.   And that, Professor Schwab, is why I think ""creating a shared future in a fractured world"" is exactly the right motto for 2018.   To be honest, the country I come from and where I am Federal Chancellor also has difficulties.   We are experiencing a level of polarisation not seen for decades.   Germany is challenged by two events, which are also a result of globalisation  -  the euro crisis, which we have now largely overcome, and the migration of recent years.   But let me tell you that Germany  -  as repeatedly shown in my earlier and current talks on forming a government  -  wants to be a country that continues to play its part in the future in order to solve tomorrows problems by working together in the world.   We believe that isolation is not constructive.   We believe that we need to cooperate and that protectionism is not the right answer.   And we believe that if we think things are not being run fairly and mechanisms are not reciprocal, then we should seek multilateral solutions, and not unilateral responses, which ultimately only serve to further isolation and protectionism.   That is why it is so important that Germany forms a government quickly.   I hope we will achieve this.   Two key ideas are important in the talks we are currently conducting.   The first is how we can safeguard prosperity for our country and its people.   At the moment, we have a situation in Germany in which we can say that we are doing well  -  we are doing very well.   All signs indicate that in 2020 we will have enjoyed eleven consecutive years of growth.   The last time we experienced that was in the 1950s.   More people than ever before are in employment.   We have a solid financial situation.   We have made good progress as regards adopting digital technology in our business sector and with Industrie 4.  0.   However  -  and I want to state this very frankly  -  we are not leaders in other areas of digital technology such as society and the state.   For the next four years, our job will therefore be to bring digital technology to our education system and bureaucracy, to give the public the option of communicating with their state via digital technology in the digital age and to create a better ecosystem for start-ups so that we remain a good place for innovation.   I take this challenge very seriously indeed.   We have no time to lose, as we know that other parts of the world are developing very rapidly in this regard.   We also see that countries such as Estonia, which just held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, are far more developed than a country like Germany, which is not at the top of the European league as regards digitisation.   We know that the spread of digital technology means we need to deal with lifelong learning and find completely new solutions for our social systems.   That means the lesson is, and must be, that disruptive technological changes alter our societies.   In an ageing country like Germany, the willingness to respond to this and to adopt new technology is, to put it mildly, not exactly widespread.   This means that the question of what resources we can allocate and how to invest in the future are major topics in our talks.   We know that if we want to keep our promise of prosperity for all in the digital age, including for everyone in Germany, we need a smart social market economy and not merely smart industry.   This means we also need to deal with the question of how we can include everyone.   I think this is one of the most urgent questions because countries that are divided are far less able to take multilateral action and to cooperate with others.   Instead, there is a very great danger that they will withdraw.   None of these questions can be solved at national level.   That is why the question of what happens next in Germany is inextricably linked with the question of what happens next in Europe.   With a view to large countries such as China and India, many problems can only be solved through cooperation at European level in the European Union.   Interestingly, regrettable as the decision by the people of the United Kingdom to leave the EU was, the more it has given us the courage to concentrate on the big picture.   I would like to say expressly that the election of French President Emmanuel Macron has brought new impetus to the European Union  -  and that will make us stronger.   What do we need to do? At a time when not all EU Member States say that an ever closer union is just what they have in mind, we need to learn to find answers to the major questions in Europe and to allow issues that can be solved locally to be solved by local people.   Otherwise, there will not be a good atmosphere in Europe.   Our priority must be to foster our economic strength.   That means that after having overcome the euro crisis relatively well, with all Member States in the euro area now experiencing growth and higher employment once again, we need to look towards the future.   In my opinion, that is mainly why we need to expand the digital single market.   In this regard, I believe there are two reasons why we are under pressure in the European Union.   Firstly, large US companies have access to data  -  and data is the raw material of the 21st century.   The answer to the question of who owns this data will ultimately decide whether democracy, participation, sovereignty in the digital age and economic success can go together.   On the other hand, there are countries, such as China, where you have very close cooperation between the state authorities and those who gather data, where they are virtually one and the same thing.   Europeans have not yet made a real decision on how they want to deal with data.   There is a great danger that we are too slow and will find ourselves overturned by events, so to speak, while we hold our philosophical debates about data sovereignty.   That means we need to take action.   I believe that our European social market economy gives us a chance to foster a fair digital age in which the privatisation of all personal data is not simply accepted as the normal state of affairs, but it is accepted that, in order to make the best of this era for the public, data is the raw material of the 21st century.   Secondly, we need to make our euro area stronger.   That means we need a capital market union  -  the capital market is still fragmented.   We need to complete the banking union.   We need to think about how we can defend ourselves against future crises that hit us from outside so that risk is not simply communitarised and we all become liable, although everyone actually needs to manage their own risks.   At the same time, we need to ensure that we are an interesting location for investment.   That is why we cannot afford to isolate ourselves.   Instead, we need to keep up with the worlds best and promote our multilateral approach.   If we want to be taken seriously as Europeans, we face another great task, namely to work together in the field of foreign policy.   Common European foreign policy remains underdeveloped.   If Europe, with its future 27 Member States, is not in a position to send a coherent message to large countries such as China, India, the United States or Russia in the future, but instead conducts foreign policy at national level while trying to be a global player, this will result in failure.   We still have plenty of work ahead of us in this regard because we are not yet able to feel certain that we can truly rely on each other.   At the same time, there has been great progress in one area, and I am pleased that Germanys Defence Minister is here with us.   Following years of discussion in Europe, we have succeeded in establishing European defence cooperation in light of the challenges we see.   That is very important for two reasons.   Firstly, this cooperation does not seek to undermine NATO.   We are very glad that the NATO Secretary General was involved in the foundation of our common defence policy and explicitly said that he sees it as complementary.   Secondly, we are in a position to take a united stance towards third countries, something that is very important to us.   This means we now have a common policy on security, development cooperation and economic development issues.   We can show that we have a coherent model, particularly as regards Africa.   This is very important.   Why are common foreign policy, common defence policy and common development policy of such great interest? If you look at the regions around Europe, you will see that most global conflicts are taking place on our doorstep.   We experienced this in 2015 when one might say globalisation arrived in Europe in the form of people, refugees, when we did not in fact deal with the civil war in Syria or with IS in Iraq.   I am sure that my Italian counterpart just reported here on the challenges regarding migration from Africa.   We basically have the Sunni-Shiite conflicts on our doorstep.   We have IS on our doorstep.   Our neighbour is Africa, just a few kilometres from the southern part of Europe.   Syria is a neighbour of Cyprus.   The fact that Europe was not the most active continent as regards foreign policy, but instead often relied on the United States of America, which is now focusing more on itself, must therefore lead us to say that we need to take on more responsibility and to take our fate into our own hands to a greater extent.   We are doing so by establishing a common defence policy and working together to tackle the challenge of migration, although there is still a great lack of unity on this topic within the European Union.   We now agree that we need to protect our external borders.   But what does that mean? Europe is an interesting continent or entity.   We created a common currency, but we never thought about what would happen if it were to be hit by crisis.   Now we are making up for lost time and basically building the foundation that we should have created from the outset.   We were incredibly proud to have freedom of movement.   When you travel around the Schengen area, you do not need to show your passport anywhere.   But we did not think about how to protect our external borders and whether we know who enters or leaves Europe.   In hindsight, we have to ask ourselves how we could have done something like that without thinking about these issues.   But we simply felt too safe.   Now we are working on an entry and exit system.   We have set up a common border protection agency.   However, one thing is true  -  since the Roman Empire and the construction of the Great Wall of China, history has taught us that isolation alone does not help to protect borders.   Instead, what we need are good relations with our neighbours, agreements and international treaties in order to know how we can cope with the challenge of illegal migration.   That is exactly what we have learned.   This is shown in the EUs agreement with Turkey and our migration partnerships with Africa.   But naturally, we still have a great deal to do.   If you think about it, you will realise that we share responsibility.   If wealth inequality becomes ever greater, we will not be able to sign treaties with one another in an open world.   We share responsibility for Africas development.   We share responsibility for what happens next in Iraq.   We share responsibility for what happens next in Libya.   We are hesitant to get involved, but we have in fact been successful in many areas in recent years.   However, there is still a huge amount of work ahead of us.   There is great consensus in the European Union on this  -  far more consensus, in fact, than on the question of how we allocate the refugees who arrive in Europe among the various Member States.   Unfortunately, there is still no agreement on that.   However, we are in a better position as regards the other issues.   Naturally, we also have the challenge of working with Africa.   We will only have the strength to do so if our own economy is strong.   It is of great importance to me personally that we work with Africa, firstly because we Europeans owe a great debt to the continent of Africa from the time of colonisation and secondly because we have a profound interest in positive development in Africa.   We say ""Africa"", but it actually has over 50 different countries with very different levels of development.   What is now important is that we work with Africa on ensuring it shares in greater wealth.   That is why we named our initiative ""Compact with Africa"" and not ""Compact for Africa"".   It is not a paternalistic partnership, but rather a partnership among equals.   This means investing in education so that economic growth is not lower than population growth.   Above all, it means using a completely new model of development aid, one based on wide-ranging development, including economic development.   We will continue working in this way.   With regard to Europe, we have a problem that I would now like to address.   Naturally, we all very much regret that the United Kingdom will no longer be part of the European Union.   Our colleague Theresa May will be here tomorrow.   On behalf of Germany, but also other countries, I would like to say that we want to continue having a good partnership with the United Kingdom in the future.   However, we will also make clear that access to the single market is tied to Europes four freedoms.   We can make no compromises on that.   But we know that we are closely linked to the United Kingdom through values, convictions and foreign policy interests.   It is up to the United Kingdom to say how close it wants this partnership to be.   We are open to all forms of partnerships.   Ladies and gentlemen, I have tried to make clear to you what I believe can be done in a ""fractured world"".   I think this always begins at home.   The more we succeed in overcoming divisions in our own countries, the more freedom we will have to focus on solidarity, cooperation and multilateralism.   Fundamentally, the solutions are always similar  -  we can leave no one behind.   Perhaps one of the greatest tasks facing us in an age of hugely disruptive challenges arising from the spread of digital technology is to prevent division.   Professor Schwab, we spoke earlier about this and I am delighted that you are supporting networks to foster discussion between policymakers and business people on what is an ethical way to manage disruptive developments.   If we do not succeed in finding an answer, the same thing will happen as in the early days of capitalism  -  we will be confronted with something like Luddites, as was the case back then.   The task now  -  and in conclusion, I call on the business people here, who live in an investment environment with conditions from another era that they did not create themselves  -  is to please work with us on transferring these conditions to a new era.   We are wrong to think it is enough for 20 or 30 percent of a countrys population to be enthusiastic about disruptive changes to ensure the entire country is on board.   It is not enough.   It requires lifelong learning and many other things.   I believe many people will be happy to go along with this.   But many others will need to be invited to do so because they are not able to keep up at once with this crazy tempo.   My hope is that this Davos forum will offer space for these questions because it brings together many people from the spheres of business, politics and society.   Then we can achieve this and prevent the mistakes of the 20th century being repeated in any way.   We know that the ways of causing great harm using disruptive digital developments and of confounding societies are of a very different nature to what we experienced in the 20th century.   However, they are at least as harmful.   That is why we need to achieve a genuine social market economy in this area, as we would say in Germany.   Then global cooperation will also work.   Germany would like to continue working on this in the future.   If you could kindly keep your fingers crossed for me that we manage to form a government, this will work even better.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos on 24 January 2018",2018-01-29,"Germany","A.Merkel",3216,"en"
"28","doc73601","Mr President, Emmanuel Macron, Mr Mayor, Charlemagne Prize Laureates, Esteemed Board of Directors, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, When it awards the Charlemagne Prize each year, the city of Aachen sends a clear signal of support for a united Europe.   Just as Europe deserves to be celebrated, people who not only believe in this Europe, but breathe life into it with their own actions, also deserve to be honoured.   The man after whom this prize is named, Charlemagne, who even during his own lifetime was referred to as the ""father of Europe"", established Aachen as his principal palace at the end of the eighth century.   It was here that he brought together scholars from all across Europe.   The impetus for science and culture that emanated from Aachen at the time can still be felt today.   Here at this Town Hall, not far from Aachen Cathedral, we sense these cultural roots at every turn.   We also have a sense of the ups and downs of European history.   In 2018, we are marking the centenary of the end of the First World War.   Todays prizewinner, Emmanuel Macron, hails from Amiens, a city before whose gates an entire European generation once perished in the trenches.   Anyone who visits the graves of those whose lives were ripped away from them because national narrow-mindedness and delusion brought our continent to the abyss can appreciate the value of European integration  -  integration that has brought us peace and freedom, democracy and the rule of law.   It is only European unity that safeguards these achievements for the future.   Glancing at the list of Charlemagne Prize Laureates since 1950 is like reading a brief account of recent European history.   From the European Coal and Steel Community to the establishment of the European Union to the introduction of the euro and the major feat that was eastward enlargement, it was always prominent public figures, courageous women and men, who gave Europe a face, all of them united by their passion for the European idea.   It is true that Europe needs and thrives on passion  -  a passion with which todays prizewinner, President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron, also goes about his work.   He was born in 1977 and was 11 or 12 years old when the Cold War came to an end.   With Emmanuel Macron, a young and dynamic politician has joined the European stage for whom European integration and the single currency are a matter of course.   However, he is also a politician who senses that this poses the greatest risk to European integration and to the European model.   Perhaps this is also because there are fewer and fewer people who, as eye-witnesses, are able to tell us about the early days of Europe, about the courage and compromises that were needed.   Emmanuel Macron knows that todays generation must continue to shape Europe with its own inspiration.   He has understood  -  and stated repeatedly, most recently at the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 17 April  -  that, in view of the different challenges facing the EU at home and abroad, todays generation will play a crucial role.   It is their historic responsibility to actively defend and strengthen European democracy, the European value system, the European social model and the dignity of each and every individual  -  in a nutshell, everything that constitutes European identity  -  and to place this on a new footing where necessary.   Emmanuel, todays date, 10 May, serves as a warning to us.   It was on this day in 1933 that National Socialists in Berlin and other German university cities burned books by numerous authors whom they couldn't abide, including works by Heinrich Heine, Sigmund Freud, Heinrich and Thomas Mann, Karl Marx and Kurt Tucholsky.   Today, 85 years or an entire human life later, we must recall that liberal values are a fragile commodity that we must continue to protect and defend.   What is important once again today  -  as you have said on repeated occasions  -  is to stand up to narrow-minded, retrograde nationalisms and the temptation of authoritarianism.   In Strasbourg, you talked about the authority of democracy, which must be stronger than the temptation of authoritarianism.   What is it that sets Emmanuel Macron apart and shows that he has deservedly won the Charlemagne Prize today, one year since taking office? Allow me to highlight three aspects.   Firstly, Emmanuel Macron knows what holds Europe together at its core.   Secondly, Emmanuel Macron has clear visions of where and how Europe should continue to develop.   Thirdly, Emmanuel Macron brings his enthusiasm for Europe to the table.   This enthusiasm not only motivates those who are committed to Europe, but, above all, it has the capacity to win over those who are hesitant or faltering; and it is decisive when it comes to opposing those who are forever stuck in the past.   Both in his election campaign and everyday political life, Emmanuel Macron has managed to embody this enthusiasm in everything that he does.   This is the basis for the fresh start that was triggered by his election as French President.   Emmanuel Macron knows that only a self-confident France can inject fresh impetus into the European idea.   This is why he is not only consistently working to implement his reform agenda, but is also reviving the intellectual, philosophical and cultural roots of his home nation.   Time and again, Emmanuel Macron underscores the importance of preserving and strengthening European democracy  -  from his address in Athens, at the foot of the Acropolis, on 7 September last year to his speech at the European Parliament.   A functioning democracy and functioning rule of law at national and European level are crucial if Europeans are to be able to develop, fundamental and human rights are to be respected and debates about the best solutions for our Community are to be held in a free and fair manner, even if this sometimes takes longer than some might like.   Moreover, Emmanuel Macron repeatedly talks about how our cultural and historical togetherness has grown over the centuries, in good times and bad.   I recall in particular his speech in Frankfurt am Main at the opening of the Frankfurt Book Fair in October 2017.   In his speech, he set out his understanding of Europes cultural identity.   It is important, at a time in which there is a greater focus on the final paragraphs of various directives and regulations, to keep this dimension in mind.   All of the nations of Europe have exchanged ideas and enriched one another for centuries in philosophy, literature, our languages, music, painting and architecture.    - I would like to thank you, Bishop, for your sermon, which reminded us once again of the dimension of religion and Christianity, which was the inspiration for all of this.   The fact that Emmanuel Macron gave his speech at the Sorbonne was no coincidence.   The Europe of scholars, the Europe of science, pre-dates the Treaties of Rome.   Beyond the realm of scholars, traders, journeymen and pilgrims also played their part in a constant exchange on our continent.   Were it not for these common foundations, European political and economic integration would have been impossible.   Differences do not divide us, but bring us together time and again  -  out of curiosity for the other and in an attempt to deepen our understanding.   Germans and French people in particular know this all too well.   We have different political cultures and often approach European issues from different angles.   We talk and listen to each other  -  and find common paths at the end of the day.   These are the challenges and the magic of Europe that I, if I may say so myself, have been privileged to experience time and again, particularly, Emmanuel Macron, when working together with you this year.   Withdrawing to the national level is not the answer.   We Europeans are united by more than merely the common market or single currency.   Europe must always be more than its shared history, more than its triumph over past differences and wars on its territory.   Europe is now the crucial project for our continents future.   In his address on the 60 th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome, Pope Francis told us, the Heads of State and Government of the European Union, that Europe will find new hope when it is open to the future.   He said this after likening Europe to a grandmother in a speech to the European Parliament.   Although it is nice to be a grandmother, the fact that the Pope says we will find new hope if we are open to the future speaks volumes.   In view of the enormous global challenges, we Europeans can only make our influence felt if we join forces.   Only by working together will we acquire or maintain our ability to act  -  our sovereignty, as Emmanuel Macron would say.   One of the exciting aspects of Franco-German discussion on sovereignty often involves the question of how much we need to protect this future Europe and how open we Europeans need to be.   How do we find the right balance between these two things? This question affects all of our discussions, be they on trade, shaping the digital single market or drawing up a common foreign policy.   What is involved here? Europe needs to show that in a globalised world, it is not part of the problem, but rather part of the solution.   That is the key question that led Emmanuel Macron to put European Union renewal at the heart of his policies through his speech at the Sorbonne.   It is also why we in Germany put the chapter on further developing the European Union at the beginning of our coalition agreement.   And it is the reason why we share Frances conviction that we need a new start in Europe.   We need to work together to provide very concrete answers at European level to the great questions of the present and the future.   Allow me to mention four areas.   Firstly, there is the question of a European strategy on innovation and investment aimed at boosting the economy in an age of globalisation and digital transformation.   Europe has always held the promise of prosperity.   But in view of the huge challenges of technological transformation, it is no longer certain that we will be the ones to determine the course of the world.   To be honest, we no longer do so in many areas.   We must aim to catch up again here, be it in the field of artificial intelligence, in which Germany and France will work closely together, or as regards dealing with disruptive innovations.   When we meet the Heads of State and Government of the European Union in Sofia next week, Germany and France will present a proposal on new institutional cooperation in Europe.   I support President Macrons idea of creating European universities in order to foster the education and research scene in Europe.   The signing of a joint declaration in Strasbourg on 12 April by those responsible in Land Baden-Württemberg and the French region Grand Est is the first concrete step in this direction.   The five regional universities in the Upper Rhine area will be merged into a single scientific region, which will serve as a role model.   This is something we urgently need because we who were the first to produce cars in Europe, for example, now rely on batteries from Asia and digital technology from the United States.   That cannot be our goal in the social market economy.   We owe it to the people to be ahead in the game.   That will only be possible if Europe makes a concerted effort.   Secondly, I would like to address European asylum and migration policy.   Freedom of movement is the foundation of the single market.   However, we can only maintain this freedom if we reform our asylum systems and make them into a common system, which must be based on the principle of solidarity, fair and able to withstand crises.   In order to preserve freedom of movement, it is also essential that we protect Europes outer borders.   But we know that walls will not help to solve the problem.   What we really need is a common policy on Africa.   Emmanuel Macron has been President for a year and in this time alone, we have already set up impressive joint projects, for example in the Sahel region, and achieved close Franco-German cooperation, which we plan to continue.   Thirdly, ladies and gentlemen, we naturally need the economic and monetary union and to ensure that it is sustainable.   Many discussions these days revolve around this very point.   I can tell you that, yes, these are difficult discussions, which we are conducting from different cultural viewpoints.   However, we will make progress on the banking union; we will make headway on the capital market union; and we will make the eurozone stronger and more competitive.   We intend to present solutions on these issues by June.   And we will do so.   Fourthly, there is the question of our common foreign and security policy.   Europes role in fostering peace and stability depends on its ability to act in concert and to speak with one voice on the international stage.   After decades of discussion, we recently managed to achieve permanent structured cooperation in defence policy.   That is a huge step forward and one that took us a long time to achieve.   But lets be honest  -  Europe is still at the very start when it comes to a common foreign policy.   However, this is what we will need for our own survival because the nature of conflicts has changed completely since the end of the Cold War.   A great many global conflicts are taking place on Europes doorstep.   And it is not the case that the United States of America will simply protect us.   Instead, Europe must take its destiny in its own hands.   That is our job for the future.   As a role model for what is happening on our doorstep, I would like to mention the countries of the Western Balkans and to thank Boyko Borisov, whose country holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union and who is here with us today, for being open to inviting the countries of the Western Balkans and the EU Heads of State and Government to Sofia next week.   We have a duty here, one that will decide on war and peace in our continent, and we must live up to it.   Germany and France have taken an important step as regards the conflict in Ukraine.   I am pleased that Petro Poroshenko is here with us today.   Although we have not yet achieved our goals in the Normandy format, we know that staying power is often a prerequisite for resolving conflicts.   We will continue to demonstrate this staying power in order to safeguard Ukraines territorial integrity and sovereignty.   Together, we  -  and in particular the UK, France and Germany  -  have defended our stance on the nuclear agreement with Iran.   We know that we are facing an extremely complex situation.   The escalation of the past hours shows us that this is truly a matter of war and peace.   I can only call on all those involved to show restraint.   We need a political settlement in the entire region on our doorstep.   Syria is not just somewhere.   It borders EU Member States such as Cyprus.   That is why we will need to work far more intensively on this issue in the coming weeks and months  -  and that also goes for Germany, which needs to play a larger role  -  in order to find a political solution for everything that involves Syria.   The many refugees who have come to Germany show us that we cannot simply look the other way.   Instead, we need to work on fostering peace in this region.   Ladies and gentlemen, European development is certainly at a critical stage.   Everyone senses that.   The founding fathers created Europe in response to the terrible wars of the first half of the 20 th century.   Europe is and will remain a peace project.   Our generations historic responsibility is to ensure that Europe is firmly established both as a positive project for the future of our continent and a part of the global order.   To this end, all Heads of State and Government will continue to work hard with the European Commission.   Each and every one of us will do our utmost, including todays prizewinner, Emmanuel Macron, who will do so with the passion that is unique to him.   My dear Emmanuel, please accept my warmest congratulations.   Your enthusiasm, dedication and courage are an inspiration to others.   You bubble over with ideas and have breathed new life into the debate on Europe with your proposals.   Todays award does not only serve to confirm that you are on the right path, but also to encourage and motivate you to continue along it with confidence.   I look forward to being able to work with you on this path.   Thank you very much and my warmest congratulations!","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the ceremony awarding the International Charlemagne Prize to French President Emmanuel Macron in Aachen on 10 May 2018",2018-05-15,"Germany","A.Merkel",2829,"en"
"29","doc73591","Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, Prime Minister Bainimarama, Federal Minister Schulze, Ladies and gentlemen from around the world, Allow me, on behalf of the entire Federal Government, to offer you a warm welcome to Berlin once again.   I would like to express my particular gratitude to my colleague Prime Minister Morawiecki.   After all, the fact that we are able to appear at this climate dialogue together is not something that can be taken for granted.   The purpose of this meeting is to prepare for the next UN Climate Conference.   The fact that its Prime Minister is here today is a firm indication that Poland will be the host.   Poland will host the Climate Conference for the fourth time.   Thank you very much for choosing Katowice for this event.   Katowice essentially stands for what we in Germany need to address, namely structural change in regions that are dominated by heavy industry and mining and in which change must be shaped with climate protection in mind.   This is anything but easy, and the issue of climate change is most tangible here.   Last year, an island nation that is heavily affected by climate change, the Republic of Fiji, held the Presidency of the Climate Conference for the first time.   This gave rise to the Talanoa Dialogue.   Its illustrious name is associated with a specific approach that is being adopted in the Pacific region.   The aim is to emphasise commonalities rather than get bogged down in conflicting interests.   This makes it easier to build mutual trust.   We can therefore set about implementing the Paris Climate Agreement with fresh ambition and a different methodology.   It does us Europeans, who are apt to fight out our differences tooth and nail, good to become acquainted with approaches from other regions for a change.   I therefore wish to offer the Prime Minister of the Republic of Fiji my sincere thanks for what you have done for the Paris Climate Agreement.   As a global community, we have reached agreement on both the Paris Climate Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.   Both of these were milestones.   In order to ensure that they are a success of historic dimensions, it is important now, of course, to actually implement what was agreed to.   This must be our task.   This is why I wish to say that the Federal Government is fully committed to the Paris Climate Agreement.   After all, an ambitious climate protection policy not only helps to mitigate the worst impact of climate change, but also offers new opportunities for innovation and therefore growth and prosperity around the world.   The Agreement has now been ratified by 178 countries.   All of the countries on board are united by the belief that global problems can only be solved together.   It is, of course, most regrettable that the United States wishes to withdraw from this Agreement.   There has, unfortunately, been no change to this state of affairs following the most recent G7 Summit.   This is why it is important that we, together with the other G7 countries, expressed a clear commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement once again, just as we did in Germany at the G20 Summit last year.   We firmly believe that we must strengthen our multilateral cooperation and that we must not allow it to be weakened.   In this year in which the multilateral approach is under pressure, it is important to get down to business also in the area of climate protection.   We want binding regulations to be adopted by the end of this year at COP24.   I believe that we need common rules for our actions.   This is also the signal that this Petersberg Climate Dialogue should, and doubtlessly will, send.   I am told that the consultations are proceeding well, and I would like to thank all those who are involved in these efforts.   Many ideas and proposals have been contributed with regard to concrete action.   Many countries, cities, companies and members of the public are working in housing construction, transport, urban renewal and urban design, as well in a host of other areas.   We should continue to build on this.   This must be a grassroots movement.   After all, we know that while the Paris objectives are ambitious, what is on the table so far is not sufficient if we are actually to achieve the two degree target.   If, as we have to acknowledge, it turns out that energy related CO2 emissions increased again last year, then this is, of course, a step in the wrong direction.   We must therefore work intensively on this matter.   But there are also rays of hope.   Progress continues to be made in the expansion of renewable energies both in Germany and around the world.   Since the first Petersberg Climate Dialogue in 2010, the share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption in Germany has far more than doubled.   In other words, this has happened within the space of eight years.   Renewable energies are now our most important source of power in Germany.   Unfortunately, we are not quite keeping pace in our efforts to expand grids, with the upshot that we are unable to use a large number of kilowatt hours.   This is why grid expansion is particularly important to us now.   As we have good conditions for wind energy in the north and many commercial hubs are located in the south, we must make it possible for electricity to be transported there.   It is very important to be able to plan in order to expand climate friendly things such as renewable energies and other investments.   For example, we decided to phase out production of coal in Germany over ten years ago.   This phase out process will be completed this year.   However, we needed more than a decade to bring about this change in a way that is neither to the detriment of people nor to the detriment of jobs, but reasonable and viable.   Together with the Economic Affairs Minister and others, the Environment Minister now has the formidable job of ensuring that this structural change in the area of lignite takes place in such a way that we can say to the people living in the affected regions: listen, things are going to change, but were thinking first and foremost about you and not just about CO2 emissions.   After all, if people were to have the impression that we were only thinking about CO2 emissions and not about the people themselves, then this would not work well as a project for society.   This will be one of the major tasks that we intend to tackle together in this legislative term.   If we have binding rules for achieving our climate protection aims, then this will improve market opportunities for climate friendly products.   Planning security is therefore vital.   We in Germany have to admit that we have to get it right again.   We have set ourselves most ambitious aims.   We endeavoured to reduce emissions by 20 percent from 1990 to 2010.   Then we said, in ten years, without having to take account of any one off impacts owing to German reunification, we want to have reduced emissions by a further 20 percent.   That was an ambitious target.   This is why we currently have so much to do in order to actually close the gap that is coming to light now, and this is why the commission that I referred to a moment ago is so important.   We know that we must take a more binding approach.   This is why Environment Minister Svenja Schulze has been tasked not only with working in the structural change commission, but also with drafting a climate protection law, which  -  that much I can tell you already today  -  will surely not be an easy task as there are a wide range of different interests and also, it goes without saying, because it will then be binding.   This means that we will have to see how we can make progress in the area of lignite.   However, we must also turn our focus to other areas.   It must be said that our biggest problem child in Germany is transport.   We have a great deal of transit traffic owing to our geographic location, with the result that all savings that are made by modern technologies are compensated by more traffic.   This is therefore one of the greatest challenges that we face.   I would like to return to the idea of a consensus based approach, from which we could certainly learn a great deal in Germany, too.   The motto of your Petersberg Climate Dialogue, ""changing together for a just transition"", sums up exactly how we need to proceed, including at European level.   The EU target for 2030 of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent compared with 1990 levels is of course important for us.   We have reformed emissions trading and also divided up the EU target among the Member States for the sectors not covered by emissions trading.   This means that Europe has a binding legal framework to enable it to play its part in implementing the Paris Agreement.   We have thus made significant progress.   However, that does not mean our work is finished, as the Member States, European Parliament and European Commission are now working on instruments and measures, for example with the aim of promoting renewable energies and energy efficiency.   What we need to admit is that we unfortunately did not include all sectors in emissions trading.   As a result, we have a mixture of market based instruments, tax measures, other types of measures and regulatory law.   For example, regulatory law predominates in the transport sector, while trade is the main focus in the industrial sector.   This is certainly not yet the non plus ultra of a coherent set of instruments, but we first need to work with what we have.   A long term climate protection strategy will depend to a large extent on the medium term financial perspective for the European Union.   The Commission has suggested that 25 percent of the entire EU budget should be set aside for expenditure on climate protection.   That is a good and ambitious start.   But alongside public spending, we also need to promote private sector investment in climate protection.   In Germany, for example, we have been putting tax benefits for measures to make buildings more energy efficient for years on the backburner.   We have a large number of pre war buildings and that gives us huge potential to reduce CO2 emissions.   But that is also one of the new Governments projects.   In order to implement the Paris Climate Agreement, we also need to look beyond the European Union and bring global financial flows as far as possible into line with climate friendly development.   We need to work at all levels to achieve this.   I would like to express my particular gratitude to the World Bank, which has pledged to use part of the agreed capital increase to enhance and expand its role in climate finance.   As far as Germany is concerned, I can say that we stand by the industrialised countries joint target of mobilising 100 billion dollars from 2020 every year for developing countries that lack financial resources, but are particularly affected by climate change.   That is why we also stand by our commitment to double public spending on climate financing by 2020 compared with 2014.   I still remember that it was right here that I expressed my support for this target for the first time.   We are campaigning for a substantial replenishment of the Green Climate Fund and underlining this through our own contribution.   We believe that this fund is crucial to the success of the Paris Climate Agreement, as we can only achieve its goals in cooperation with developing countries.   We are also demonstrating solidarity in the NDC Partnership.   All of you here are experts on this subject, but for others, I would like to explain that this involves nationally determined contributions.   In the meantime, 89 countries have joined the NDC Partnership.   We support the implementation of nationally determined contributions, for example in Morocco, India or Brazil, where we are promoting investments in solar thermal energy, as well as in Indonesia and Colombia, where we are helping to develop climate friendly transport systems.   I think there can never be too many examples of this type.   With every step forward we take on the road to modernising our economy and infrastructure in terms of ecology, the cost situation generally improves.   In turn, this boosts sustainable investments.   For example, the costs of generating electricity by photovoltaics have decreased by almost 50 percent since 2014.   As a result, higher investments can be made in this technology again.   That is really very interesting because when I was Environment Minister  -  a long time ago now, from 1994 to 1998  -  it was impossible to imagine that solar energy and its costs would ever reach the levels we see today.   But then we realised that the prices fell dramatically when there was a certain mass effect.   That is also one of the examples  -  the same goes for wind energy  -  of how it is worthwhile helping new technologies to reach the market.   Without support, these technologies would never have become profitable, but with support, they were able to become profitable and end their dependence on subsidies.   That is the actual message.   We know that climate change is not a question of belief  -  I think everyone in this room knows that  -  but rather a fact.   The years 2015, 2016 and 2017 were the warmest on record.   Extreme weather events are also increasing in Germany.   Every year, many millions of people in developing countries fall back into poverty because of natural disasters.   The economic costs of doing nothing can scarcely be calculated, but they are enormous.   This needs to be reiterated in discussions because many people say that they dont have the money at the moment.   But we will pay the price anyway if we do nothing.   That is why the question of adapting to the climate change that has already occurred is naturally also one we need to address far more intensively.   We must not forget that the continued survival of island states is already acutely at risk.   When I arrived here, Svenja Schulze told me that the representative of the Marshall Islands had given a compelling presentation on what is happening and shown how this literally threatens peoples survival.   That is why we believe that climate risk finance and insurance are two further topics we should not only include in G7 and G20 talks, but also continue working on.   We want to set up a global facility.   The aim is to do so at the World Banks Annual Meeting in Bali in October.   Germany has already pledged 90 million euros to this facility.   Climate protection is not a luxury we treat ourselves to  -  it is a question of ecological necessity and makes economic sense.   Climate protection and adjustment are investments in the future, as well as investments in peace and stability.   A successful UN peace policy is inconceivable without an ambitious climate policy.   That is why Germany, which is grateful to have been elected to the UN Security Council recently by a large number of votes, will make climate protection and the security aspects of climate change priority topics during its two year term on the Security Council.   I think the Security Council is a good forum where we can continue working and also try to collaborate with many of you as partners in addition to our efforts in the Petersberg Climate Dialogue and UN conferences.   Ladies and gentlemen, the opportunities of low carbon development are now obvious.   Lasting growth and prosperity cannot be achieved if the whole package is not sustainable.   We know this requires patience, but it involves a joint goal.   With this in mind, I hope your talks at this event will continue to be productive.   You have already had in depth discussions.   Please continue your talks in the spirit of consensus, but also in the spirit of urgency and sustainability.   As I said, as Head of Government I also now know which contradictions one needs to master.   It is not only a question of saying nice things  -  we also need to take practical action.   We need to follow the path of sustainability and Germany is committed to doing so.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the 9th Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin on 19 June 2018",2018-06-19,"Germany","A.Merkel",2700,"en"
"30","doc73581","Nuncio, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, On behalf of the Federal Government, I am delighted to welcome you to Schloss Meseberg.   Some of you have been here before.   The Federal Foreign Office is represented today by Minister of State Müntefering and State Secretary Lindner.   And of course the Federal Chancellery is also represented  -  by its Head, Minister of State Hoppenstedt, and by Minister of State Widmann-Mauz.   I also see Parliamentary State Secretary Flachsbarth, the Government Spokesperson, State Secretary Seibert, and the Deputy Government Spokespersons, so you will have plenty of interlocutors from various parts of the Government later on.   I would like to extend a warm welcome to you and to invite you to enjoy the somewhat more relaxed atmosphere here.   In recent months and particularly in recent weeks, you will sometimes have asked yourselves where Germany and its Government are headed.   It is true that we have had some difficult days, but I believe that we have now found a good basis for continuing our work.   And after all, that is what people in Germany and many of you, who represent your countries, also expect.   The debate in Germany reflects some of what we are also seeing worldwide.   These are turbulent times.   Some certainties have been called into question in recent years.   This makes it all the more important that we work well together as nations and try to maintain constant contact with one another.   That is the precise aim of this reception.   Working with, rather than against, one another frequently requires the willingness to compromise.   Perhaps it is worth looking at history to see how particularly after the Second World War people were willing to make great compromises because of the dreadful terror they had experienced.   We also need to make compromises possible today.   But of course, working together in many ways  -  multilateralism  -  is not a form of altruism.   Every country needs to assert its interests and work in the international community to ensure that what is specific to its own people and country is heard.   But in view of the many challenges, we sense that as a global community we are also a community with a common destiny.   That is why we will continue to play our part in global, joint multilateral cooperation and to try to strengthen it in any way we can.   We will be able to do so particularly well over the course of the next two years, as we have been elected as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2019 and 2020.   I would like to thank the many countries that supported us.   This provides a broad basis for our work.   We want to focus on preventive work and to make crisis prevention and peacekeeping a priority.   We will also address points of overlap between security and climate change.   We are aware that in Africa in particular, there is a very close connection between the topics of security and safeguarding livelihoods, which are partly at risk as a result of climate change.   Naturally, we conduct our international cooperation in various ways, not only in the UN Security Council, but also in the G20, for example.   Argentina will host the next G20 summit.   We have promised our support, partly because we are still very familiar with the various topics of our own G20 Presidency last year, including free trade, the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and the Partnership for Africa.   Europes partnership with our neighbouring continent of Africa is of great importance to me personally.   That is why I will host another G20 Africa conference in October.   Our aim is to continue discussing what we furthered last year, namely the Compacts with Africa.   We do not want to simply lose sight of this initiative, but rather to carry on exploring how we can achieve joint results.   Africa has a young population, which expects opportunities for its future.   I am pleased that the African Union has drawn up its own ideas in its Agenda 2063.   And I believe that we Germans, but also Europeans, have a duty to work with Africa on these concepts.   For example, this involves access to education and jobs.   And let me say frankly that traditional development aid alone is no longer enough.   It is needed, but the most important thing is that we look at how we can support private-sector investment, entrepreneurship and small companies so that self-sustaining growth will develop.   Agenda 2063 provides a good basis for this.   We are also trying to ensure that peace can be achieved and the fight against terrorism won.   That is why Germany, along with France and other countries, has been very active in supporting a G5 Sahel Joint Force for the five Sahel countries of Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, the Niger and Chad.   We stand shoulder to shoulder with these countries in the difficult fight against terrorism.   The United Nations, the European Union and a large number of countries, including Germany and France, as I already mentioned, are involved in this.   Of course, the local security forces do not only need training and equipment.   Above all, they need the trust of their own populations.   We hope that the forthcoming elections in Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be a success, as both elections are of the utmost importance for peace and development in the two regions.   We are also following developments in Ethiopia with great interest.   We are aware of how much courage Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is demonstrating.   I hope this course will lead to success, also as regards Eritrea.   That is something we would very much welcome.   Ladies and gentlemen, as also discussed at the most recent European Council, we remain very concerned about the situation in Libya, where we know that the state can and must be further developed.   We hope that elections will be held there this year.   We are aware that the large number of migrants in the country is one reason for the great challenges Libya faces.   I would thus like to take this opportunity to thank the international organisations, particularly UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration.   They are working under the most difficult circumstances to try to make life a bit more bearable for people.   However, we know how much we still have to do in this context.   The further use of chemical weapons in Syria has brought home to us once again how difficult the situation is there.   France, the US and the UK lived up to their special responsibility as permanent members of the UN Security Council and made clear that the Chemical Weapons Convention must be implemented without exception.   I very much welcome that in the future the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will not only be able to investigate whether chemical weapons have been used, but also to identify those responsible.   It is simply logical and just that the worst crimes no longer go unpunished.   We are currently watching the Syrian regimes offensive in southwest Syria with concern.   This will certainly not foster de-escalation.   Women and children are being forced to flee.   We must do everything we can to put a stop to this as soon as possible.   Naturally, we must not lose sight of the fact that we need a political process in Syria, as no conflict can be resolved by military means alone.   That is why we are discussing this with various parties.   To this end, I visited President Putin in Sochi a few weeks ago.   We wish UN Special Envoy de Mistura all the best.   At European level, we will work with the US and do our utmost to make headway.   I call on Iran to live up to its responsibility.   And with a view to Turkey, I hope we can overcome this terrible situation despite our different interests.   This is a dreadful war that has been going on for many years now.   In the meantime, almost half of the Syrian population has been displaced.   That is why we all need to do our utmost at the political level.   Ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago I visited Jordan and Lebanon.   I saw how much these two countries are doing to give refugees opportunities close to their homeland, how affected they are by the situation and how their own population naturally has rightful expectations.   Germany is trying to be a good partner to these countries.   We are also concerned about security in the Middle East as a whole.   Along with France and the UK, we have decided to uphold the nuclear agreement with Iran.   But we also say very clearly that both Irans regional activities against Israel and in Yemen and its ballistic missile programme are grounds for concern.   That is why these topics also need to be discussed.   We are pleased that significant progress has been achieved on the Korean Peninsula as regards denuclearisation together with President Trump and the President of South Korea.   Of course, what counts now is that North Korea complies with what has been agreed.   It is absolutely vital that the Korean Peninsula be denuclearised.   If we see progress, then we can also talk about easing sanctions.   Ladies and gentlemen, we will meet at the NATO summit in Brussels next week, where we will discuss the various tasks of our defence alliance.   We have made significant efforts in Germany in recent years to increase our defence expenditure.   This is a contentious subject in our country.   However, we understand that we must take on greater responsibility.   We are committed to NATOs goals and undertakings.   They are of the utmost importance for our transatlantic alliance.   We are pleased that we will also be able to take on new tasks.   Further decisions must be made, including on NATO´s Command Structure, troops readiness levels and a training mission in Iraq.   We want NATO and the European Union to work more closely together.   Permanent structured cooperation can lead to real progress in the European Union, also as regards strengthening NATO.   We have over 170 arms systems in Europe alone.   The US has fewer than 50.   You can imagine how inefficient military collaboration is in Europe when every arms system needs its own maintenance, training units and personnel.   This means we need to become more efficient.   And we must also be willing to invest more in defence.   While I am on the subject of NATO and the European Union, I would also like to speak about Europes neighbour Russia.   We see the possibility of conducting permanent talks in the NATO-Russia Council.   These talks should also be intensified.   We hope that we will also be able to further implementation of the Minsk Agreement with Ukraine and Russia.   France and Germany have taken on responsibility in this field for many years.   It grieves us to see that the ceasefire is still broken every single day.   But we won't give up hope.   We know that relations with Russia could be significantly improved, and this is something that Germany in particular aims to achieve.   Our transatlantic relations, particularly as regards the US, should and will be strong.   Two days ago, on 4 July, the US celebrated Independence Day.   We Germans primarily learned from the US what freedom and independence mean.   Allow me to recall that the Berlin Airlift was set up 70 years ago.   The Allies brought essential supplies to West Berlin, which was completely cut off at the time.   Many older Berliners still have fond memories of the Candy Bombers and of how happy they were as children to see the little parachutes carrying sweets.   Solidarity, a community spirit and the fact that former war opponents became supporters, allies, partners and friends were prerequisites for German unity to finally become possible in peace and freedom.   As someone who grew up in the former GDR, I am still happy about the new opportunities that this united Germany gives us.   We will not forget any of this and we want it to play a role in our relations with the US today.   Economic issues, particularly tariffs, are currently being discussed.   I can only hope  -  and we will try to do our part here  -  that we do not end up in a downward spiral of trade conflicts, but instead manage to achieve good and mutually beneficial trade relations between the European Union and the US.   We benefit from each others strengths.   That is why we need the transatlantic partnership.   Ladies and gentlemen, we are looking forward to the German-Chinese intergovernmental consultations in the coming days.   Outside the European Union, Germany also holds intergovernmental consultations with Israel, which will take place this autumn.   We also conduct such talks with India and will continue them in the near future.   We want to intensify relations with China in particular on the basis of reciprocity.   We have certain wishes in this regard.   China is reminding us that it would like to continue investing in Europe in the future.   That is also something we need to take seriously.   We should discuss this topic very openly.   Ladies and gentlemen, the French President was our guest here a few days ago.   We signed the Meseberg Declaration here.   You are aware that time and again, German-French or French-German input is important for the further development of the European Union.   We know that the others cannot accept everything  -  that is clear.   But if Germany and France do not get along, there is mostly no real progress in Europe.   The Élysée Treaty was signed 55 years ago, thus opening a fundamentally new chapter in our relations.   We intend to redraft the Élysée Treaty to meet the conditions of the 21st century.   And we will do so by the end of the year.   We will commemorate the centenary of the end of the First World War together this year.   The French President will hold a remembrance ceremony.   After many centuries of conflict and two terrible world wars, it is still virtually a miracle that we can live together peacefully in Europe today.   Germany and France were long regarded as sworn enemies.   Fortunately, that now belongs to the past.   That we can all live together peacefully in the European Union is not only a miracle, but also the reason why we endeavour  -  sometimes in protracted negotiations that last the whole night  -  to make the European Union stronger.   To mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War in 2014, we in the Federal Republic of Germany decided to adopt a process focused on the future, namely to work with the countries of the Western Balkans that are on the path to EU accession, but still have a long way to go on this path.   The next Berlin Process conference will take place in London next week.   I am pleased that London will host this conference.   I am still sad that we have to deal with questions concerning the UKs withdrawal from the European Union.   The UK Prime Minister was here yesterday.   Let me say clearly that we want to continue to have good and close  -  extremely close  -  relations with the UK even after it leaves the European Union.   I think that especially during these negotiations we feel how much unites us.   I am particularly pleased that Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -  or North Macedonia, as it will be called in the future  -  have managed to take a step forward.   I wish Macedonian Prime Minister Zaev all the best and I would like to thank all those who were involved in this process.   At next weeks NATO summit, we will see if real progress has now been made.   I hope this will come to a successful conclusion.   Excellencies, it was not possible for me to mention every country.   I hope that those who were not mentioned do not feel disadvantaged.   We want to work well with all of you and to so do openly and honestly.   If there are conflicts, then we must discuss them, but always with the aim of shaping the future in a spirit of mutual trust because we are all part of the global community and only when all parts work well will the overall result be good.   Thank you very much and have a good time!","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the reception for the Diplomatic Corps in Meseberg on 6 July 2018",2018-07-12,"Germany","A.Merkel",2697,"en"
"31","doc73571","Prime Minister, my friend Erna Solberg, Director-General Tedros, My friend Bill Gates, Professor Ganten, Fellow members of the Bundestag, My colleague Gerd Müller, Ladies and gentlemen, Health - who doesnt wish for it? There is hardly any other issue that people are more concerned about, precisely because it affects each and every one of us and because it ultimately decides whether or not we can realise our plans for this life.   Staying or getting healthy is, however, not just a topic for us as individuals.   It is not the sole responsibility of individuals.   Health is also a shared task, a global task.   We all know what devastating consequences above all infectious diseases can have - first and foremost at the human level, but also from the economic point of view.   After all, diseases and epidemics do not stop at national borders, they do not just put individual health services to the test but can also endanger the security and development of entire regions.   That is why people here have also rightly pointed out the major impact that the third goal in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has on many of the other goals.   This means that responsibility for healthcare does not stop at national borders but is in fact a shared responsibility.   Ladies and gentlemen, by gathering here this evening you have shown your readiness to shoulder this responsibility.   But how do we go about it? That is the central question which is the focus of both the World Health Summit and the Grand Challenges Meeting of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.   I am very grateful that it was possible to combine these two meetings, as this increases the clout of global health policy.   This is the 10th Global Health Summit to be held here in Berlin.   Professor Ganten, you launched the Summit in 2009 on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Berlin Charité hospital.   The very name Charité - charity - highlights the philanthropic principle of furthering public health.   The World Health Summit takes up this tradition.   It brings together experts from research, business and politics to develop shared and coherent strategies for the world.   I myself felt this was a great idea from the very outset and am thus delighted to serve as patron of this Summit.   Precisely because global questions need global answers - from richer countries and less prosperous countries - we all need to work together to develop effective medicines and vaccines.   We have talked about this this evening.   We need efficient healthcare systems.   We need to prevent both pandemics and resistance to antibiotics.   We need more generally to promote a healthy environment - clean air, clean water - and work to ensure people have enough food.   In a nutshell, we need cooperation.   My friend Bill Gates, for many years you have been showing us the way forward.   Here you work side by side with governments and organisations such as the World Health Organization and with foundations such as the Wellcome Trust.   I would like to thank you very much.   You fight tirelessly for a better life for the poorest of the poor.   We in Germany are also committed to this goal.   We have considerably increased our engagement for global health inter alia in research - and not just in financial terms.   We have also repeatedly put this important item on the international agenda - in formats such as the G7 or the G20 and especially, of course, when Germany was hosting G7 and G20 meetings.   I am also particularly concerned about working together to combat neglected diseases associated with poverty.   We have to work together against the big three diseases, that is HIV, malaria and tuberculosis.   Practical examples that have been presented this evening show that this approach works.   We need to develop vaccines to prevent epidemics.   And we have to curb resistance to antibiotics as we cannot simply presume that new antibiotics will be developed every time.   To achieve this goal, Germany will, for example, increase its funding for antibiotic research to 500 million euros for the next ten years.   I believe other countries will also step up their engagement.   What is important, however, is that we network our efforts and actually ensure that we do not all set the same priorities but work together to cover the whole spectrum of issues.   To move forward with research into antimicrobial resistance, we, together with many G20 partners, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, have created the Global AMR Research and Development Hub.   Mr Tedros, the WHO has supported and guided the work of the Hub in an advisory capacity.   Thank you very much indeed.   We all sense however that the principle of multilateralism is currently under increasing pressure and being put to the test.   Yet particularly when it comes to health issues, the value of multilateralism is plain to see.   That is why I hope that this will not just be a forum for specialists but also that we will send a clear signal that multilateralism is a win-win situation for everyone in this world.   We saw it for ourselves during the 2014 Ebola epidemic which claimed more than 11,000 lives in West Africa.   Neither national nor international systems were adequately prepared for such a crisis.   We saw it as a wake-up call and we have woken up! Today, we can see that considerable progress has been made.   The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in spring was contained relatively quickly - also and especially because procedures within the WHO were much better coordinated.   I hope the same applies to the tasks yet to be performed.   The new mechanisms are in place.   The Contingency Fund for Emergencies which Germany also supports has proven its effectiveness.   This should also be the case when new cases of disease break out.   I would therefore appeal to all those shouldering responsibility in the region to ensure aid workers are granted unhindered access so that disease does not spread further and to ensure structures are created to promote transparency.   There is no point in concealing the outbreak of disease.   What we need in fact is full transparency.   That is why I would like to thank WHO Director-General Tedros most sincerely once more for his reform efforts and for setting up clear emergency structures.   You are taking steps here based on your own experience from your previous work.   Thank you.   We will stand by you.   Ladies and gentlemen, much has been achieved if we can curb epidemics.   But we need to do more than that.   Health is a prerequisite for well-being, prosperity and a dignified life, in other words, for exactly what the 2030 Agenda stands for with its 17 SDGs.   Each and every investment in the health system is an investment in the people, in stable demographic development and in hope for the people.   I am delighted that, together with Erna Solberg and Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo, I was successful in asking Director-General Tedros to draw up an action plan on the implementation of the Agenda health goal together with all relevant players.   The first version is on the table.   Even just for the last page with the ten signatures, considerable efforts were involved.   Thank you all for your cooperation.   We will now develop indicators for taking stock in 2023.   We will involve civil society.   Germany advocates organisations, different actors and also countries committing clearly to the action plan and working together to implement it.   Time is of the essence.   Ladies and gentlemen, ""Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family"".   This is what we read in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   A healthy life must not depend on where you are born or live.   In every corner of the world, it is a humanitarian imperative to be able to rely on a functioning health system.   This is a task which challenges humanity.   It is high time for us to work in targeted fashion to perform this task anchored in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   I am convinced that this meeting will play its part in ensuring we can move forward.   Much remains to be done but if we all roll up our sleeves we have a good chance of achieving the Agenda goal by 2030.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the World Health Summit and the Grand Challenges Meeting, Berlin, 16 October 2018",2018-10-23,"Germany","A.Merkel",1381,"en"
"32","doc73551","Mr Kagame, Chairperson of the African Union, Presidents and Prime Ministers from Africa, Federal Chancellor Kurz on behalf of the European Union, Christine Lagarde, President Kim, Mr Faki, Chairperson of the African Union Commission, President Adesina, Ladies and gentlemen and Cabinet colleagues, Id like to bid you all a very warm welcome.   This isnt a routine meeting.   Rather, its something quite special.   I can say from Germanys perspective  -  the situation would be very different in France  -  that this is the largest meeting of Heads of State and Government with African Presidents in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.   The fact that so many of us have come together here today underscores the importance of this meeting, which follows on from last years conference.   At that time, Germany held the G20 Presidency.   It was the idea of the then German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, to enter into a partnership with Africa in the form of a Compact with Africa.   Then the Development Minister had the idea of creating special development partnerships.   Id therefore like to extend an especially warm welcome to the current German Finance Minister and the Development Minister, who are sitting here upfront.   As you can see, all of us have committed to a partnership with Africa.   Why is Africa so important to us? Its important to us because were neighbours, as you can see on a world map, and because we therefore have a vested interest in ensuring that not only we in Europe but also the entire African continent is thriving.   In some ways, Africa is a very rich continent.   Just think of its natural resources and, above all, young people  -  of whom there are not so many in Europe.   Africa also has a rich history and a wonderful culture.   From a business point of view, I believe we can say that Africa is the continent with the greatest potential for development.   That means that anyone who wants to do business on the continent should get started as soon as possible.   However, I dont want to gloss over the difficulties.   For there are problems in many African countries, in which people are very poor, in which not everyone has access to electricity, to water or other basic necessities.   You all face the pressure of the high expectations of young people in your countries.   Its therefore important to talk openly and frankly about the problems, about the progress made and about the opportunities offered by our cooperation.   The Compact with Africa initiative also tackles the preconceived ideas which some companies have about investing in Africa because theyre often unfamiliar with the continent and dont know how to get loans, how much legal certainty they can expect, how much bureaucracy there is or to what extent they may have to deal with corruption.   These and many other questions mean that some companies are unsure whether they should do business in Africa, in your countries.   Therefore, in our view, the aim of the Compact with Africa is twofold.   On the one hand, it is intended to lead to higher standards and more transparency, particularly in your finances.   In return, we can offer better investment conditions for our companies.   This morning I told the Investment Summit that in this legislative term we have set up a fund of one billion euros with a view to supporting small and medium-sized enterprises from Germany or Africa.   In the case of countries where conditions are better and more transparent, more favourable conditions could be given for credit guarantees.   That will then result in a higher volume of investment.   Its no coincidence that direct investment is higher in the Compact with Africa countries than in other African countries.   We hope that this will continue to pay off.   Well, the G20 Presidency only lasts one year.   After that, theres a danger that everything will be forgotten.   Im therefore very grateful to the IMF, the World Bank and also the African Development Bank for saying that they would continue to shoulder responsibility within the framework of this initiative.   For its not hard to understand that the issues involved cannot be resolved within a year.   Rather they have to be dealt with on an ongoing basis.   I therefore very much welcome what these institutions are doing.   Japan will assume the G20 Presidency next year.   And that country, too, will continue to address these issues.   Ive invited Federal Chancellor Sebastian Kurz to be with us today because Austrias European Union Presidency has also focused on Africa and will hold a conference focusing on the continent in December.   We want to work closely together to avoid any duplication or even triplication of effort.   For we should know what each other are actually doing.   It goes without saying that the more attractive conditions are in your countries, the better it will be for investment and trade, as well as for education and vocational training.   One issue which has been very much on our minds and about which weve learned a lot during the last few years is what a modern development policy can look like.   For a long time, we in Germany shaped development policy solely in collaboration with NGOs.   Thats not enough.   Although they run local and very good projects, these projects very seldom result in sustainable economic development.   The first person who pointed this out to me many years ago was Kofi Annan who said that we had to focus more on small and medium-sized enterprises and on economic investment, naturally also with the aim of ensuring sustainability.   Then we in Germany developed the GIZ further.   Nowadays, the ministries  -  from the Federal Foreign Office to the Economics Ministry, the Environment Ministry and the Development Ministry as well as the Finance Ministry  -  cooperate very closely with each other and try to design fit-to-purpose packages.   I also want to say quite frankly that of course weve also looked to see what China is doing.   China approaches your countries with very compact investment offers.   And naturally you say that if dealing with Europeans always means first of all gathering together financing from various sources then its better to accept other offers.   Weve thus learned something from observing China, especially as it has experienced remarkable development during the last few years and thus knows very well how to leave poverty behind and increase prosperity.   I dont want to repeat what I said this morning.   I merely ask that whenever you negotiate a double taxation agreement with the Finance Ministry: lets try to accelerate the whole process.   Thats good for both sides and creates a substantial degree of certainty for our companies.   Id like to conclude by asking you to talk about whats important to you in your statements.   Moreover, Id like to point out that this meeting is being streamed live and that your remarks are thus accessible to a wider public.   However, that doesnt mean that you cannot also make critical comments.   We want to learn from one another today.   We dont want to simply say nice things to each other.   If were going to spend so much time together then our discussion has to produce results of value to us all.   Those were my words of welcome.   I now ask President Kagame to speak first on behalf of the African Union and then Sebastian Kurz, who  -  as Austrias Federal Chancellor  -  will look ahead to his High-Level Forum Africa-Europe in December.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the Conference on the G20 Compact with Africa in Berlin on 30 October 2018",2018-10-30,"Germany","A.Merkel",1264,"en"
"33","doc73561","Messrs Presidents, Prime Ministers and Ministers, Excellencies, Gerd Müller, Professor Große, Mr Liebing, Ladies and gentlemen, Im delighted to warmly welcome you all to Berlin today as members of the Compact with Africa initiative.   And Id like to sincerely thank the organisers of this conference: the German-African Business Association and the Sub-Saharan Africa Initiative of German Business.   Together, we want to send a clear message today that good and productive neighbourly relations between Africa and Europe are important to us.   Were neighbours, were partners  -  good economic prospects in African states are very much in the interest of us Europeans.   That will require state but most especially also private investment.   How we get from official aid to private investment is the major task we face  -  its also the modern development policy which our Minister Gerd Müller is pursuing.   It goes without saying that business opportunities and risks are always weighed up against each other.   Better investment conditions  -  both for African and European companies  -  are needed in order to make the decision to commit easier.   As well as strengthening Africa as a location for investment, we have to make sure that trade relations between Europe and Africa are fair.   Working together to improve the conditions for investment and trade is the core idea behind the Compact with Africa and the reform partnerships concluded during Germanys G20 Presidency in 2017.   Our aim was to talk with and not about Africa.   Thats also one of the key lessons weve learned from traditional development aid, which often didnt produce the results we had hoped for.   Thats why we have to engage in dialogue with you.   The Compact initiative is based on another, a new approach.   Its about new forms of equal and long-term partnership which benefit everyone involved to the same degree.   Naturally, every country in Europe, just like every country in Africa, has its own unique features and its own attributes as a location for business and investment.   Its therefore important that each Compact country improves its investment climate by carrying out its own reform measures.   On the other hand, however, each participating country should also say how it would like to be supported and what concrete support it needs on the path to reform.   The IMF, World Bank and African Development Bank are involved in this process  -  whether it be drawing up suitable reform measures for each individual country or verifying the implementation of the obligations of the Compact and partner countries.   Germany, too, is playing its part via reform partnerships with various countries.   I was able to find out more about this cooperation, indeed to gain a first-hand impression, during my recent trip to Africa.   I can tell you that the first effects are already evident.   Although foreign direct investment in Africa as a whole has decreased during the last few years, it has increased in the Compact countries.   I know that time is of the essence to all of you.   You have to get results quickly because your population expects quick answers and quick results.   We know that.   Thats why we, too, are trying to be quicker.   Investors will most likely have confidence wherever Compact countries have carried out reforms.   As I pointed out, this is reflected in the volume of direct investment.   Id therefore like to express my sincere thanks to companies and investors who will be presenting their investment projects today.   Youre contributing to Africas economic development.   And youre setting an example for others, encouraging them to take a closer look at this continent with its 54 countries and its huge potential for growth.   We were very much focused on Asia for many decades.   I believe we have to pay more attention to Africa in future.   The German Government wants to be of assistance here.   In the case of trade with Ghana and Senegal, for example, three guarantees in principle have been granted for export credits totalling 160 million euros.   The German Government has considered how we can get further measures off the ground.   We intend to establish a development investment fund for small and medium-sized enterprises; for both European and African companies.   The idea is to ensure that investments and loans can be financed in order, for example, to enable companies to enter new markets.   We want to do more to safeguard exports and investments by German companies in the Compact countries against political as well as non-payment risks.   Of course, our measures always hinge on the progress of the reforms and the debt sustainability of each individual country.   I have to tell you that the state wont be able to assume all of the risk.   However, we want to offer more than we have done in the past.   This will make it possible, for instance, to ensure that companies or investors are not subject to double taxation.   Thats why we attach so much importance to double taxation agreements, which weve already concluded with five Compact countries.   Were negotiating with three others.   I hope that more such agreements can be concluded.   And Id like to add that we for our part are doing everything we can to ensure that these negotiations take place quickly.   Furthermore, we want to see new work and vocational training partnerships with companies and institutions in Africa.   This is about developing certain branches in suitable locations by, for example, promoting the establishment of regional industrial and commercial parks.   Not least, were seeking new bilateral reform partnerships with Senegal, Morocco and Ethiopia.   These are the key elements of the package of measures we want to get underway.   We see this as a means of complementing and further developing the Compact with Africa initiative.   This conference highlights our desire to engage in and revitalise cooperation based on partnership.   Improving investment conditions is of vital importance to this.   Its in our shared interest.   I would like to thank you all once more for coming here and am now looking forward to what I can see and experience at this business forum.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the G20 Investment Summit – German Business and the Compact with Africa Countries",2018-10-30,"Germany","A.Merkel",1019,"en"
"34","doc73541","Federal President, President of the Bundestag, President of the Bundesrat, Mr Schuster, Excellencies, Esteemed colleagues from the Cabinet, Federal Government and Regional Parliaments, Guests of honour, Eighty years since the pogrom night  -  why, ladies and gentlemen, am I talking to you about this today? The first, obvious answer is the simple fact that this pogrom night took place 80 years ago today, and it is a matter of decorum for the Federal Chancellor also to reflect on these events on a day of remembrance.   The events of the November pogroms in 1938 were an important watershed on the path towards the betrayal of all civilised values that was the Shoah.   The consequence of this were six million murdered Jews and the unspeakable suffering of millions more people.   There is no way to express all of this suffering.   Words fail me here.   This is why I am speaking to you today primarily for another reason.   I am speaking to you because these historical events  -  the betrayal of all civilised values that was the Shoah  -  were unique, singular, that is to say unprecedented in all of their abominable facets, culminating in  -  put in a cynical way  -  factories for industrialised mass murder or  -  put precisely  -  concentration camps and death camps.   I would therefore like to use this day and this opportunity to think about three questions together with you: how did this happen? How did the majority of the population respond? What lessons can we learn from this? Ladies and gentlemen, 9 November 1938 was one of a series of days and nights during which National Socialism showed its terrible face.   Around 1400 synagogues, prayer rooms and Jewish meeting places were plundered, destroyed and set ablaze.   Some 7500 shops were smashed and looted.   Neighbours became perpetrators and criminals.   Many people enriched themselves, welcomed the violence or engaged in violent acts themselves.   Anti-Semitism had been the order of the day since 1933.   The new political conditions allowed many Germans to indulge long-held resentments, hatred and violence.   This did not stop with the destruction of Jewish synagogues, shops and livelihoods.   In November 1938, around 400 people were murdered or driven to commit suicide.   Some 30,000 Jews were imprisoned in concentration camps; hundreds of them were murdered.   The November pogroms were a milestone on the road to the Holocaust.   Ladies and gentlemen, we tend at important commemorative events to focus our minds exclusively on these days and all too easily overlook the fact that they usually do not happen in isolation, but are part of a wider process.   And 9 November is no exception here.   We all know what happened thereafter  -  namely the betrayal of all civilised values that was the Shoah.   And yet the pogrom night of 9 November 1938 was preceded by something without which it would not have been possible.   It is worth taking a look back at history in order to understand this.   This can, of course, only be a very cursory glance in the context of such a speech.   Hatred for the Jews or anti-Semitism has existed in Europe since the Middle Ages.   Until well into the 19 th century, this hatred was primarily religious.   At the end of the 19 th century, with the Industrial Revolution, social issues became pressing and the secular nation states gained in importance.   It was in this context that what was termed racially motivated anti-Semitism emerged, one bent on racist exclusion, expulsion and, ultimately, annihilation.   In the Weimar Republic, Jews were, from 1919 onwards, allowed to assume the highest offices of state for the first time.   Anti-Semitism nevertheless remained the order of the day  -  particularly among those who were hostile to democracy.   As early as 1920, the NSDAP published its so-called doctrines and principles of anti-Semitism, which intended to preclude Jews from becoming citizens.   In the 1920s, when the NSDAP formulated these demands, many events were indicative of the rising tide of anti-Semitism  -  in both words and deeds  -  such as the murder of Reich Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau in 1922 and the attacks on Jews in Berlins Scheunenviertel in 1923.   Even from this brief historical summary, we can see that the evil of National Socialism did not come about overnight at all, but grew steadily.   Ladies and gentlemen, why am I talking in such detail about all these things that happened before 9 November 1938, 85, 90 and 95 years ago? I do so because I firmly believe that we can only learn the right lessons for us today and in the future if we consider the November pogroms of 1938 to be part of a process that was not only followed by the terrible chapter that was the Shoah, but also had a pre-history.   Because in this way we can see what the consequences are if  -  as under National Socialism  -  what was once punishable behaviour is first tolerated and then, ultimately, declared to be desirable behaviour.   Prejudices that had previously or always been held could now give way to open violence with impunity.   This was accompanied by a large majority of the German population looking the other way, remaining silent and indifferent and, above all, going with the flow.   The political conditions changed with the liberation of Germany in May 1945 and the new start that ensued.   The normative delineation of racism and anti-Semitism was fundamental.   However, racism, anti-Semitism and prejudice did not simply disappear.   If we today  -  80 years after the November pogroms and almost 70 years after the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany  -  consider the situation today, then the picture is a mixed one.   Germany is home once again to a flourishing Jewish community  -  an unexpected gift following the betrayal of all civilised values that was the Shoah.   However, we are, at the same time, witnessing a worrying anti-Semitism that threatens Jewish life in our country and other places in the world that we believed to be safe.   This anti-Semitism is, to an increasing degree, being openly unleashed in the form of at times uninhibited hate-speech on the internet, and in the public sphere in general.   Unfortunately, we have almost become accustomed to the fact that each and every Jewish institution  -  synagogues, schools, kindergartens, restaurants, cemeteries  -  must be guarded or afforded special protection by the police.   We are also frightened by attacks on people who wear a kippah, and were aghast at the right-wing extremist attack on a Jewish restaurant in Chemnitz back in August.   This is a form of anti-Semitic crime that evokes frightening memories of the beginning of the persecution of the Jews in the 1930s.   However, such incidents must not only be a cause for concern for the survivors of the Shoah  -  they are terrible for all of us.   But our horror and disbelief are not enough.   The appointment of a Federal Government Commissioner for Jewish Life in Germany and the Fight against Anti-Semitism  -  as right and understandable as this is  -  is likewise not the end of the story.   We must ask ourselves two pressing questions here.   Firstly, what have we really learned from the betrayal of all civilised values that was the Shoa? Secondly  -  and related to the first question  -  are our democratic institutions strong enough to prevent anti-Semitism from continuing to gain traction, or even from becoming acceptable among the majority of the population in the future? Perhaps we might pause for a moment and reflect what people from a distant future  -  maybe, shall we say, in the next century  -  might make of our world of today; a world that is at risk once again of losing sight of the common good because it excludes people, disputes their rights or threatens them on account of their faith, origin or otherness.   How could our world of today, where the way in which we interact with one another is worsening at all levels once again, be regarded from the standpoint of a distant future? Probably with complete incomprehension; and perhaps also with a sense of pity for us today that we are still, and once again, at risk of repeating terrible mistakes and having to learn where the attempts of the few to divide us can lead.   Our Basic Law draws the conclusion from the horrors of National Socialism and the failure of the Weimar Republic when it states the following in Article 1, paragraph 1: ""Human dignity shall be inviolable.   To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority.  "" This must be the immutable guiding principle of our actions; both politically and in society as a whole.   What does this mean in concrete terms? Firstly, each and every person is unique.   Groups must never be simply lumped together or our society subdivided into ""us"" and ""them"" or ""us"" and ""the others"".   Everyone has the right to be recognised and treated as an individual by state institutions.   Secondly, democracy is the very best of all conceivable social orders, even if it makes our lives complicated from time to time.   Democracy is about more than winning majorities.   It is about balance and achieving an equilibrium between majority and minority, government and opposition.   It is about the separation of powers and requires the freedom of the press, opinion and art just as humans need air to breathe.   Democracy protects minorities.   This means the best possible participation in the life of society for everyone.   Thirdly, the state must take resolute and decisive action to oppose denigration, marginalisation, anti-Semitism, racism and right-wing extremism.   The state must also undertake firm action when hatred of Jews or hatred of Israel is expressed verbally or non-verbally by people living in our country who have a different religious or cultural background.   In concrete terms, just as there must never be a general suspicion against Muslim people when violence is committed in the name of their religion, it also follows that everyone who lives in our country must uphold the values of our Basic Law.   Fourthly, educational work must always place todays anti-Semitic attacks and excesses in a wider historical context.   Knowledge of history and a critical awareness of the past are indispensable to this end.   Allow me to quote the historian Professor Norbert Frei: ""This is not something that we have, but something that we must constantly develop anew.  "" With this in mind, each generation must strive anew to achieve a critically enlightened understanding of our past.   Wherever this happens, Norbert Frei continues, historical remembrance will not be an empty ritual, but rather history will remain meaningful and new questions and perspectives may even emerge.   Fifthly, the work of remembrance has a fundamental role to play in this regard.   At the award ceremony for this years Peace Prize of the German Book Trade, the prize-winning scholars Jan and Aleida Assmann pointed to the importance of our cultural and national memory.   They describe our nation as ""a union of people who are also capable of remembering shameful episodes in their history and taking responsibility for the monstrous crimes committed in their name.  "" It is for this reason that pausing to reflect and remember together on days such as these is important.   It is also important to realise that remembrance needs places that tell of what happened, and places that commemorate the victims and clearly state who the perpetrators were  -  such as the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe at the heart of our capital city.   Its underground Information Centre seeks to illustrate the dimensions of the Shoah.   This is why many individual names are mentioned there in order, and I quote, ""to dissolve the incomprehensible abstract number of six million murdered Jews and to release the victims from their anonymity"".   This is about people at the end of the day.   Each and every one of them had a name, a unique dignity and identity.   Calling to mind this identity and dignity helps us not to get bogged down in loss.   It helps us not to decouple memory from our present-day lives, but to keep connecting with the past and, based on this, to shape the future  -  a future in which we recognise the human face in every person and in which we encounter one another as fellow members of one and the same human race.   Ladies and gentlemen, we are once again living at a time of profound change.   Rapid technological upheavals are giving people cause for concern.   Many people are feeling left behind by the accelerating pace of globalisation and digital progress.   At times such as these, there is always a particularly great danger that those who respond to the difficulties and consequences of these upheavals with supposedly simple answers  -  simple answers that all too often go hand in hand with a brutalisation of language on the streets and the internet  -  gain in support.   We must take a firm stand against the onset of such trends.   This is why we commemorate today with the promise that we will stand up to the attacks against our open and pluralist society with all due resolve.   We commemorate in the knowledge that standing by and watching as red lines are crossed and crimes committed means, ultimately, that we are complicit.   We commemorate in the belief that the democratic majority must continue to be watchful.   We need to stake out normative boundaries.   The rule of law must display no tolerance when people are attacked on account of their belief or the colour of their skin.   Ladies and gentlemen, reaching these conclusions is our task not only on such a day of remembrance.   We should think about this each and every day.   Let us all work each day with the insights we have today to ensure that events such as those that occurred 80 years ago never happen again.   That is the message and the essence of our acts of commemoration today.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the central commemorative event marking the 80th anniversary of the Reichspogromnacht",2018-11-09,"Germany","A.Merkel",2264,"en"
"35","doc73531","Presidents, Emmanuel Macron, Prime Ministers, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, This morning  -  and I believe I speak for everyone present  -  we witnessed a moving ceremony commemorating how, on 11 November at 11 oclock in the morning, precisely 100 years ago, word spread swiftly along the Western front that an armistice had been declared.   Trumpeters on horseback signalled the ceasefire.   Soldiers celebrated.   Earlier, we took a look at the many emotions of the day.   A new term needed to be coined for that war.   It came to be called the World War.   In France and Great Britain, it is referred to as the Great War.   Mankind had never been engulfed in such a cataclysm.   When the war began, there was great euphoria, along with celebratory cries and propaganda promising swift victory.   When it ended, 17 million had died.   How could something like this happen in developed countries  -  countries that claimed to be enlightened? Technological advances were misused.   Weapons of mass destruction, poison gas, bombs and submarines were employed regardless of the consequences.   Basic principles of civilisation were completely ignored.   General de Gaulle is reported to have said that, although Germany was defeated, we all lost.   This war, with its senseless bloodshed, shows where national arrogance and military hubris can lead.   It also reminds us of the disastrous consequences of a lack of dialogue and compromise in politics and diplomacy.   Today, one hundred years on, we look back at this war.   We commemorate the victims  -  the women, men and children.   We commemorate the soldiers who lost their lives on the front.   However  -  and for this, dear Emmanuel, I owe you gratitude  -  standing still is not an option.   So we must ask ourselves: What does it mean for us today? We all were requested to contribute a book to the peace library.   I chose Briefe an den Sohn (letters to my son) by Käthe Kollwitz.   In it, a great artist from Germany writes about her two sons.   One died fighting in Belgium in the early days of the war, and she desperately hoped that her other son, a medic, would survive.   ""The heart is a heavy burden to bear,"" she writes.   ""Why, oh why, do the most beautiful youths die, and the old live on?"" It is an honour for me to stand here today, as Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.   I also want to thank Emmanuel Macron for what we were able to experience yesterday.   Until recently, in Compiègne, where the armistice was signed nearly 100 years ago, a commemorative slab bore the words ""the arrogance of the Germans"".   We have now replaced those lines with ""friendship"" and ""partnership"".   This sends an impressive signal.   It is of course also an obligation.   Because, today, this is anything but self-evident  -  especially in view of the suffering that the Germans brought upon their neighbours, Europe and the world in two world wars.   It is an extremely generous invitation, extended to friends.   The peace that we have today, and that we sometimes take too much for granted, is anything but a matter of course.   We must work to maintain it.   That is why I, too, want to express the concern that I feel during our present commemoration.   The concern, for example, that national blinkers will again be put on, which could once again lead to action that simply ignores our mutual interdependence, relations and ties.   We see that international cooperation, the peaceful balancing of interests, and even the European peace project, are again being called into question.   We see a willingness to push through ones own interests  -  if need be, by using force.   Last year, Mr Secretary-General, there were 222 violent conflicts in the world.   222! According to UNHCR, the number of forcibly displaced people in the world reached 68.  5 million.   That is more than the population of France, for example.   These numbers are even more striking when we look at who is hardest hit.   More than one billion children are currently affected by conflicts.   Children account for 52 percent of refugees.   According to estimates, up to 250,000 girls and boys are being misused as child soldiers.   Considering what we have experienced, and that we think weve learned the corresponding lessons, we should be shocked  -  just as we are by the images coming out of Syria and Yemen.   But this should not make us speechless.   First and foremost, we must not be paralysed.   That, too, is indeed a lesson from history.   We must not simply resign in the face of these armed conflicts  -  no matter how removed the fighting may be from us in Europe.   We must not write off any state, religion, ethnicity or single person.   This means we must work towards a political solution in Syria.   Different groups are engaged, but so far they are not making a joint effort.   We, Emmanuel Macron and I, recently met with the Russian president and the Turkish president in Istanbul to bring together various strands of activity.   I want to thank Mr de Mistura and the United Nations for everything that is being done.   Many obstacles remain on the path.   But we must not give up.   During our joint work and commemorations here, we must bear in mind that what is probably the worlds largest humanitarian catastrophe is currently unfolding in Yemen.   We are not seeing many images, and this is the only thing keeping us from being shocked.   Yet a lack of images must not lead to inaction.   That is why Yemen was discussed in the margins of many meetings here  -  and I am grateful for that fact.   I think the world must take action, so that a ceasefire and humanitarian access can be achieved.   Friends, a lack of willingness and inability to engage in dialogue are exactly what fed mistrust and the logic of war that set in motion the violent juggernaut of 1914.   Lack of communication.   There is a book about the First World War that refers to ""sleepwalkers""  -  this was the main reason behind the collective failure that led to crisis and catastrophe.   That was precisely the conclusion to which Woodrow Wilson, the President of the United States, came at the time.   With his famous fourteen points, he among other things called for a great league of nations.   He proposed that an institutionalised dialogue be established through which positive pressure would be brought to bear, with a view to preventing future conflicts.   We all know that the League of Nations was set up  -  and failed.   The world witnessed Germany unleash World War Two and commit the Shoah, whereby it betrayed all civilised values and shook faith in humanity.   Afterwards, nothing was the same.   Granted, nothing could be.   The answer was to create the United Nations.   The international community established a legal order and a framework for international cooperation.   The foundation for this was laid with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that the UN General Assembly adopted 70 years ago.   I often wonder if, today, we were again called on as an international community to adopt such a declaration of human rights  -  would we be up to the task? I fear not.   That is why we must protect and further develop what was achieved in the immediate aftermath of the horror.   I know how difficult it is to adopt binding resolutions.   But we did manage to agree to ban the use of force in the UN Charter, and to make the UN Security Council the sole body authorised to use it  -  although the Council is unfortunately often deadlocked.   I often read and feel that many ask themselves: what does the United Nations do? Of course, on a day-to-day level, the organisation does not live up to its ideals.   How could it be otherwise? But does this mean we should say that life would be better without the United Nations? To that, I clearly say no.   Institutions can easily be destroyed  -  but building them up is incredibly difficult.   We all know that most of the challenges and threats we face today cannot be addressed nationally, but only through joint effort.   That is why we must accept this collective responsibility.   It is why you, Secretary-General, dear Antonio Guterres, deserve full support.   Full support for your everyday work and for the UN reform.   We must put prevention at the top of the agenda.   We must keep conflicts from occurring in the first place.   The 2030 Agenda with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals is a good roadmap.   We know that we need to fight poverty and hunger if we want peace.   We know that we must create access to education, protect the environment and improve economic and social justice.   In Germany, we are aware of these challenges  -  and we look forward to being part of the effort to implement this agenda during our two-year tenure as a non-permanent member on the Security Council.   The First World War demonstrated how isolationism can be our undoing.   If isolationism did not provide a solution 100 years ago, then how could it today  -  in a world as intricately interconnected as ours, with five times the population? That is why we chose ""shaping an interconnected world"" to be the motto of our G20 Presidency last year.   We also will work closely with Frances G7 Presidency to achieve progress in this regard.   Close international cooperation based on shared values that are laid down in the UN Charter  -  this is the only way to overcome the horrors of the past and shape a reasonable future.   Ladies and gentlemen, friends: After the dread that we spread above all with the Second World War, we Germans were extended a hand of reconciliation.   Great trust was placed in the young Federal Republic.   This was the only way that we were able to enter the fold of the international community.   An essential part of this later became the Franco-German friendship.   We have forward-looking and courageous women and men to thank for this, such as Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet and Konrad Adenauer.   They paved the way, so that old rivalries could be thrown aside and policies of peaceful balancing of interests and cooperation pursued.   Those with political responsibility need great courage to step forward and say: I must reach a compromise.   But uncompromising attitudes are certain to lead to great discord.   Other neighbours, too, showed tremendous character and courageously promoted reconciliation.   I want to mention Wladyslaw Bartoszewski of Poland, who already prior to 1945 gave thought to how Poles and Germans could reach out to each other in the future.   Only a few representatives from Poland are among us here today, because Poland is celebrating the centenary of its independence  -  or, more accurately, its regaining of independence with the end of the First World War, because for much more than 100 years its territory had been divided up between Germany and Russia.   For too long, many people in Europe could not be part of the peace project.   They had been divided by the Cold War.   But in Europe, we saw that what was previously divided could also be reunited  -  and this is especially true for us Germans.   I want to thank Emmanuel Macron and the initiators of this Peace Forum for making sure that the event is not attended only by politicians, but also by NGOs, unions, associations, researchers, and private citizens.   Because peace cannot be purely a political project.   Peace must be earned by the people in our countries.   Thats why work for peace is so multi-faceted.   It is therefore my sincerest hope that this effort will not be short-lived  -  with the life expectancy of a house fly, as we say in Germany.   We want it instead to become a process.   We want this armistice centenary marking the end of the First World War to give rise to a process that leads to more peace.   I am not under any illusions that a rocky road lies ahead.   However, if we all are convinced that we need to work together, then we may just be able to build a better world.   After what we have experienced, we must seize this opportunity.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkelat the opening of the Paris Peace Forum on 11 November 2018",2018-11-11,"Germany","A.Merkel",1996,"en"
"36","doc73521","Federal Minister Giffey, Minister-President, Former Womens and Family Ministers, Parliamentary State Secretaries, State Secretaries, Mayors, Ladies and gentlemen, When Marie Juchacz, about whom we have already heard today, became the first woman to give a speech in the National Assembly in February 1919, she began by saying ""Gentlemen and ladies"".   Merely addressing the audience in this way caused amusement.   As we have heard, it took great courage for women to win their place in politics because even as late as 1902  -  when women already had the vote in New Zealand  -  the Prussian Minister of the Interior said that women had no business in politics.   At the turn of the century, women all around the world began fighting for their own rights.   They forged links with other women and supported each other.   And it must be said that this was an arduous, exhausting, but ultimately successful battle.   On 12 November 1918, 100 years ago today, women finally arrived in German politics.   This was a shining moment in the history of democracy.   I will never forget the time I spoke with the former King of Saudi Arabia  -  he is now deceased  -  about the issue of equal rights in his country.   His first reaction was to ask me since when women had actually been allowed to vote in Germany.   And when I said that they had got the vote less than 100 years ago, he looked at me with great sympathy and said that it had taken us a very, very long time.   And he was right.   That is why I am pleased about the many anniversary events that are now taking place.   And I am happy that we are paying tribute to women such as Marie Juchacz and Hedwig Dohm, who truly demonstrated great courage.   We know that looking at history often gives us the strength to shape the future.   That is why it is very, very important to look at the past.   After all, not only did these women fight for the rights of a group or particular clientèle  -  they fought for a human right.   The struggle was for equality between all people  -  and that remains the case today.   A society can only be just if it puts equality between women and men into everyday practice.   That is why it is truly fitting for us to pay humble tribute to our female activists for womens suffrage.   They were very courageous and had to stand firm until they achieved a breakthrough.   It is thus a very great honour indeed for me to give the speech on the centenary of womens suffrage as Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.   After all, the right to vote was merely a start, although naturally it was very significant.   It often took and takes a long time  -  too long  -  to make progress on equal opportunities, equal status and equal treatment.   Looking back, it seems incredible that until 1977 a woman still had to ask her husbands permission if she wanted to work.   And marital rape has only been a crime since 1997.   Ideas have changed significantly in society in recent decades.   Role models such as you, Ms Peschel-Gutzeit, Rita Süssmuth, Ms Lehr and Ms Bergmann, who are all here with us today, made great progress.   These days, no one ridicules a young girl when she says she would like to be a minister or even federal chancellor when she grows up.   I have even heard that some people ask if a man can become federal chancellor  -  no, Im not making that up! At the end of 2017, over 71 percent of women in Germany were employed  -  12 percent more than in 2005.   Parental leave, parental allowance and the statutory entitlement to childcare make it easier for mothers to return to work.   And as I already mentioned, regulations have also been adopted for men because equal opportunities for women and men can only exist in the first place if both change their roles.   But we still have a lot to do.   Equal pay is one of the big questions on the agenda.   This involves two sorts of questions.   One question concerns salaries in different professions and what it means if there are typical professions for women and men.   And the other is that there are still  -  particularly in sectors without statutory wage agreements  -  hidden inequalities in pay.   That is why I thought it was great when Ms Rehn said there was complete transparency in her company.   That is very important.   Naturally, we still need to improve many things.   We recently adopted a law aimed at providing better childcare.   We want to invest a further 5.  5 billion euros in the quality of childcare by 2022.   We need very variable and flexible structures so that ideally we can give every woman and every man a real choice.   We can only achieve justice and fairness in our society by working as allies, not as opponents.   Every woman in Germany should be able to go her own way  -  irrespective of whether or not she has children, is a single parent or in a relationship, or works full time or part time  -  and to return to work, Ms Peschel-Gutzeit is right, whether her job is as a mechanic, manager, teacher or nurse.   Women and men should have the same opportunities to develop their talents.   Of course, we have achieved a lot since the time of Marie Juchacz, but we still have a great deal to do.   The most important thing is that we do not accept any backsliding.   And of course, politics plays a key role in this.   That is why the German Bundestag is not a shining light in this legislative term.   I just spoke about that.   In the last legislative term, 36.  5 percent of its members were women  -  now 30.  9 percent are.   That is almost exactly the same percentage as in the Sudanese parliament.   I think we really cannot content ourselves with that.   I do not only want to talk now about Rwanda, where 61 percent of the members of parliament are women, but above all to underline a structural aspect concerning the African Union Commission.   African regions are represented in this Commission, in each case by a woman and a man.   This automatically means parity in the Commission, and I think that is really a very good thing.   We need to watch out so that our way of thinking in Europe, which can verge on arrogance at times, does not automatically lead us to believe that things may not be so good yet in other places.   For example, women play a major role in Africa.   And it is also important that we support them via development policy.   Now, we do not only need to look at the Bundestag  -  in some regional parliaments, only a quarter of the members are women, although women account for over half of the population.   I think that the percentage of women in parliaments is a fundamental issue in our democracy.   We will simply have to take new paths here, too.   To be honest, I am still shocked about the number of female mayors  -  I wasnt really so aware of it.   It is also crucial that we look at this again.   I am delighted that Ms Reker of Cologne is here with us today.   There are many signs that we also need to think about new ways for people to be politically active.   We need formats that suit our century.   And I am not so sure that men always welcome it either when all local party meetings take place on Saturday mornings.   So it shouldnt come as a surprise here either.   When I think of the average age of the members of my party, naturally I look longingly at the Greens.   In my party, the average age is over 60, while in the Greens it is 48.  7.   But even that is higher than the average age of the German population, which actually has one of the highest average ages in the world.   Consequently, we need to attract young people and that means finding formats that work for them.   These formats may then fit even somewhat better with those tailored to women.   In other words, everyone must have a chance to get involved.   And there is no getting round it, the quotas were important, but the goal must be parity  -  parity everywhere, be it in politics, business, the administration, academia and indeed in the cultural sphere.   We recently marked 20 years of the office of Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media.   If you look at the number of female conductors, renowned female painters and women in the arts, then you need to ask yourself what is going on because it cannot be that women are less talented.   In this area, too, we need to specifically support women to help them achieve a breakthrough, become better known and make headway.   This really goes for all sectors in society.   In the civil service, the coalition government has set a goal of achieving an equal number of women and men in all senior management positions by 2025.   In some cases, we are still a long way from that, but we are aware of the role model function of the civil service.   That is why I think it is good news that women now hold four of the eight positions of Director-General in the Federal Chancellery.   I am rather proud of that.   As regards the business sector in Germany, much is still in a sorry state.   In the United States, there are at least two women on the board of 90 percent of the largest publicly traded companies.   In the UK and France, this figure is around 50 percent  -  but in Germany it is a mere 16.  7 percent.   This means that we are a long way from truly making use of skills and talents in the business sector, too.   And we really should not and cannot afford to continue like this  -  also with a view to demographic change.   It was the right approach  -  Ms Giffey reported on this  -  to also take a step as regards supervisory boards via the law on more women in management positions.   In fact, no one still claims now that no women are available for such positions.   We still have major problems in medium-sized enterprises.   We need to keep working on that.   And should a woman ever head up a DAX company, then that should not be something special, but rather the first step to normality.   We need to keep repeating that.   My hope is that it will become standard for women and men to share employment, childcare and housework equally and that no one will be forced into a particular role or division of labour because of their sex.   And I hope that this will not take a further 100 years, as equality between women and men is an important indicator of whether and to what extent a society is just.   I think we are all certain that a societys future viability depends on how just it is.   And that is why this is equally in the hands of women and men or men and women.   Many thanks, and thank you for being here today.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the event in Berlin on 12 November 2018 to mark the centenary of women’s suffrage",2018-11-12,"Germany","A.Merkel",1845,"en"
"37","doc73511","President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, Members of Parliament, Commissioners, Ladies and gentlemen, Nearly 50 years ago, Walter Hallstein, the former German Commission President, referred to European integration as an ""endeavour of unparalleled boldness"".   The year was 1969, ten years before the first direct European elections took place.   At the time, the European Community was still in its infancy.   Many of our greatest accomplishments  -  Schengen, the single market and a single currency  -  were still mere visions.   But the foundation had been laid.   And with that, after centuries marked by wars and dictatorships, the citizens of Europe for the first time held out hope for a sustainable, peaceful and stable future.   Today, I am pleased and grateful to be standing in front of the largest democratic parliament in the world.   Together, you  -  751 Members, elected in 28 member states  -  represent more than 500 million people.   That is nearly seven percent of the worlds population.   In your House, we can feel the heart of European democracy beating.   The debates, which are held in 24 languages, are a sign of this.   Your House also stands for another aspect of Europe, namely diversity.   It is one of our great strengths as Europeans that we  -  time and again, and despite our diversity  -  have allowed ourselves to be guided by a willingness to compromise.   Despite our different origins and opinions, we have so far always managed to arrive at solutions that benefit the community as a whole.   More than eleven years have passed since I first addressed this House.   At the time, in 2007, Germany had assumed the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.   In that speech, I spoke about diversity as a unifying, rather than dividing, factor, about freedom that constantly needs to be defended anew, and about Europe needing freedom the same way that people need air to breathe.   I also talked about a fundamental value that characterises Europe  -  a value that brings freedom and diversity together in Europe.   I spoke about tolerance.   I spoke about how tolerance is the soul of Europe, about how it is an essential, fundamental value that defines European idea.   Over the past eleven years, we have also seen how much the world has changed  -  how, if you will, Europes soul has been put to the test.   Global political, economic and technological challenges are developing at an ever greater pace, and they are becoming more and more profound.   We have lived through a great public debt crisis.   The European Union has not been spared the scourge of international terrorism.   Wars and armed conflict are taking place only a few hours by plane beyond our doorstep.   Global refugee and migration flows are also having a direct impact on us Europeans.   The advance of digital technology is changing our way of life at breakneck speed.   We are feeling the effects of climate change.   Old allies are calling tried and proven alliances into question.   The United Kingdom will be the first country to exit the European Union.   These days are marked by intensive negotiations, and we more than ever are getting a sense of how deep that impact will be.    -  I want to express my heartfelt thanks to Michel Barnier for his work.   Members of this esteemed House  -  why am I saying this? We all realise that predicting developments has become more difficult.   But we also realise something else.   The likelihood that interests can be asserted at global level by a single actor is steadily decreasing.   Vice versa, this means it is becoming ever more important for us Europeans to take a united stance.   For this, everyone in the European Union must now more than ever show respect for others and their interests.   We must now more than ever have a common understanding that tolerance is the soul of Europe, that it is a key part of what makes us European, and that only through tolerance can we develop a willingness to consider, and fully identify with, the needs and interests of others.   This will help us forge true European solidarity, without which successful action is impossible.   This solidarity is built on tolerance.   It is the basis of our strength as Europeans.   A strength that is unique in the world, for three reasons: Firstly, solidarity is a universal value.   Standing up for one another is an essential prerequisite for every functioning society.   This holds true for families, villages and sports associations, as it does for a community such as the European Union.   Solidarity is a fundamental component of the European treaties.   It is an indispensable part of our system of values.   Solidarity is encoded in our European DNA.   We support countries and regions, by promoting their economic development or assisting efforts to combat youth unemployment.   We help one another when natural disasters strike.   When terrorist attacks or nuclear accidents occur, we stand by one another.   During the European public debt crisis, we put together so-called rescue packages to help countries solve their economic and financial problems.   These few examples already show that the individual EU member states, and thereby also the citizens of the European Union, are not left in the lurch during tough times and crises.   However, these few examples also show that national decisions always also have an effect on the entire community.   Therefore, secondly, solidarity always means that everyone must bear responsibility for the community as a whole.   Specifically, this means anyone who undermines rule-of-law principles in their own country, or who curtails rights of the opposition and civil society and restricts the freedom of the press, thereby jeopardises the rule of law not only in his or her own country, but for everyone in Europe.   Europe as a community of law can of course only function when the law applies  -  and is respected  -  equally everywhere.   Anyone who seeks to solve problems only by taking on new debt, or who ignores binding obligations, also calls into question the foundation of a strong and stable euro area.   That is because our single currency can only function if every single member meets national obligations for sustainable finances.   Anyone who undermines a unified European stance when interacting with third parties  -  regarding, for example, agreed sanctions or questions related to human rights  -  also undermines the credibility of European foreign policy as a whole.   Because Europe will only make its voice heard in the world if it stands united.   This means that showing solidarity always requires overcoming national egotisms.   I am well aware that Germany has not always behaved well, and that at times others take issue with its behaviour.   For example, in the years before 2015, it took us far too long, also in Germany, to accept that the refugee issue concerns all EU member states, and that it must be dealt with through a pan-European approach.   From this it follows, thirdly, that solidarity that benefits all, also ultimately and rightly understood, means solidarity that is in everyones own best interest.   Respecting and supporting others, on the one hand, and pursuing ones own interests, on the other hand, are not contradictory.   Quite the opposite is true.   One example is our cooperation with African countries of origin in the sphere of refugees and migration.    -  The President addressed this just a moment ago.    -  This cooperation helps Europe, because it establishes more orderly, controlled and reduced movements of refugees and migrants to Europe.   At the same time, it helps people in the countries of origin by improving their living conditions.   We can also prevent them from embarking on what is often a perilous journey to Europe.   Another example is Europes commitment to worldwide climate protection.   These efforts are an ecological and social necessity for protecting the resources on which life depends  -  also for everyone here in Europe.   Europe benefits when industrialised and newly industrialising countries produce less greenhouse gasses, and when all of our economies become greener.   What is more, all Europeans benefit when the euro area, too, develops harmoniously, becoming a haven of strength and stability.   All Europeans benefit when everyone joins in European civil protection efforts.   All Europeans benefit when we help those who are most severely affected by displacement and migration.   It is a matter of tolerance that we respect the different reactions in the various member states when it comes to the question of taking in refugees  -  because each member state has its own history and demographic development.   However, it is a matter of solidarity that we do everything in our power to find a common approach for tackling this and other challenges as a community.   These are hallmarks of Europe: solidarity as a universal, fundamental value; solidarity as a responsibility for the community; and solidarity in terms of ones own rational interest.   Ladies and gentlemen, unity and common resolve are essential if Europe is to succeed.   I therefore want to highlight three spheres that I think should be at the top of our agenda.   Firstly, there is our foreign and security policy.   We already now realise that we Europeans are much better able to defend our interests whenever we act in concert.   Only by taking a united stance will Europe be strong enough to make its voice heard in the global arena and defend its values and interests.   Its simply true that the times when we could fully rely on others have ended.   This means nothing other than that, if we Europeans want to survive as a community, we must make a greater effort to take our destiny into our own hands.   This means that, in the long term, Europe must become more capable of taking foreign policy action.   We must therefore be ready to rethink our decision-making processes, also by lifting the unanimity requirement wherever possible  -  that is, in areas where this is permitted by the treaties.   I have proposed that we establish a European Security Council with rotating member state membership, in which important decisions could be more swiftly prepared.   We need to create a fully capable, European military force for rapid deployment to affected regions in times of crisis.   We have made great progress on permanent structured cooperation in the military domain.   That is a good thing, and these efforts have received wide support here.   Yet  -  and I say this very deliberately in view of the developments in recent years  -  we ought to work on the vision of one day establishing a proper European army.   Yes, thats how things stand.   Four years ago, Jean-Claude Juncker said: a joint EU army would show the world that there would never again be a war between EU countries.   That would not be an army in competition with NATO  -  dont misunderstand me  -  but it could be an effective complement to NATO.   Nobody wants to call traditional alliances into question.   But, ladies and gentlemen, it would then be much easier to cooperate with us.   When, as is the case at the moment, we have more than 160 defence or weapons systems and the United States has only 50 or 60, when each country needs its own administration, support and training for everything, we are not an efficient partner.   If we want to use our financial resources efficiently and are pursuing many of the same objectives, nothing speaks against us being colllectively represented in NATO with a European army.   I dont see any contradiction there at all.   That would then also involve .  .  .   (heckling from the floor)  -  I welcome that response.   That doesnt bother me.   Im used to parliament.    -  That, incidentally, would also involve the joint development of weapons systems within Europe.   And it would also involve  -  this is a difficult task, also for the Federal Republic of Germany  -  developing a joint arms export policy, because otherwise we would not be able to present a united front in the world.   Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, Europes economic success is a crucial factor.   It forms the basis of our strength and determines whether our voice will even be heard in the world.   Without economic clout, we will have no political influence either.   I am delighted that Jean-Claude Junckers programme, the Investment Plan for Europe, has had a significant impact in recent years and that we have already launched 340 or 350 billion euros of investments out of a total volume of 500 billion euros envisaged by 2020.   That is a good programme to boost investment.   I am aware of how often there have been calls for more investment, particularly from you in the European Parliament.   That has now been set in motion.   But we ought to discuss the issue again in due course.   For, ladies and gentlemen, 340 billion euros is not peanuts, but a tangible contribution to greater prosperity in Europe.   It goes without saying that a stable and prosperous Europe also requires a stable economic and monetary union.   We intend to continue to develop the European Stability Mechanism.   We are working on the banking union.   We are working on a eurozone budget, a concept proposed by Germany and France.   In my opinion, that should be dovetailed very closely with the medium-term financial perspective.   We are also advocating that liability and control go hand in hand.   That means that a banking union and ultimately a European deposit guarantee system are dependent on the prior reduction of risks in the individual countries.   The two are interconnected.   European solidarity and individual responsibility are always two sides of the same coin.   As the European Council  -  Germany and France at least are certainly working to achieve this  -  we will have tangible results to show by December.   We will also make progress on one issue that is currently being discussed in great depth and in which you, too are heavily involved  -  digital taxation.   The question for Germany is not whether we have to implement digital taxation  -  that goes without saying in the digital age  -  our question is how to proceed.   I think it is one of the rules of good democratic behaviour that we take note of the Commissions proposals but can also supplement them.   We believe that the best option in an international context would be to find an international solution.   We advocate minimal taxation.   But if that doesnt work, we cant afford to wait until doomsday, but should take a Europe-wide approach.   And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what Germany is working to achieve.   If we are honest, when we look to the future and stop to think about our prosperity, we have to accept that the major innovations now no longer always or usually come from Europe, as was the case 100 years ago and 130 years ago.   Today, a large proportion of ground-breaking innovations come from Asia and from the United States.   That of course begs the question: Will we dictate the form of the mobility of the future on the continent which once invented the car? It bothers me, for example, that we arent able to manufacture battery cells.   The fact that Chinese enterprises are now investing in Germany is okay.   But I think we ought to make a great effort to ensure that in Europe we are also in a position to master a drive technology of the future and to make the production of battery cells possible here, too.   We have the European instruments to achieve this.   We have all that at our disposal  -  as we already do with chips today.   We need to be among the leaders in quantum computers.   We need to develop a joint strategy for artificial intelligence.   All this is still possible, because we have a strong industrial basis in Europe.   We can build on this, and we now need to make use of it.   Research and innovation are therefore central factors in our future prosperity.   Ladies and gentlemen, the third issue I want to raise is the topic of refugees and migration.   During the euro crisis, we had many obstacles to overcome in order to reach a joint solution, but we succeeded.   But on the issue of refugees and migration, Europe is not yet as united as I would like.   As this is a central issue which concerns relations with our neighbourhood, we need to find common approaches here.   We have indeed made progress.   We all agree that we need common European border management.   With hindsight I will say that it was no doubt somewhat careless to create a Schengen area of free movement but only now to work on compiling entry and exit records in order to confirm who is in our country and who is leaving.   Nonetheless, it is right that we are doing so now.   It is right that we are developing Frontex.   In my view, the Commission proposals are good.   Here, too, the important point is this: If every country wants to retain its national competence and nobody wants to hand over any responsibility to the European border guards, no matter how extensive and how competent they are, they will not be able to do their job.   In this area, too, we need to forego our national competences to some degree and work together.   We also need to consider how we can best share the workload with regard to development assistance, development cooperation and economic development in Africa.   We are now seeing outstanding results  -  that wouldnt have been possible two or three years ago  -  when individual member states work in cooperation with the Commission in specific African countries and thereby achieve so much more than if we all headed off there to do our own thing.   Yet we have a great deal more to learn in this area.   Nonetheless, I believe we are moving in the right direction.   Another priority needs to be for us to develop a common European asylum procedure.   If every country makes decisions based on different criteria, the people affected are aware of this and then it is no wonder that secondary movement takes place within the Schengen area.   It is vital that just as we are developing a common level playing field for the internal market, we make the effort to develop common standards also on such sensitive issues as asylum law and humanitarian responsibility.   Otherwise we will not be able to handle the task with which refugees and migration confront us.   Ladies and gentlemen, those were just three examples of many.   The protests show that I have hit the mark.   That is good, and I am honoured.   I believe that people want Europe to tackle the very issues that are uppermost in their minds.   People want a Europe that provides answers to their burning questions.   That doesnt mean that Europe has to have a finger in every pie, as it were.   It is still the case that not every problem in Europe is a problem for Europe.   Solidarity does not mean omnipresence.   But solidarity does mean that Europe engages itself where it is needed and that it is then able to act firmly, decisively and effectively.   I am convinced that Europe is our best chance for lasting peace, lasting prosperity and a secure future.   Our gathering in Paris at the invitation of the French President to remember the brutalities of the First World War 100 years ago ought to have reminded us once again what happens when nations have no respect for one another and what happens when alliances such as the League of Nations, which was founded in the wake of the First World War, fail.   Even greater horrors followed.   This is why we cannot afford to squander this European opportunity.   We owe that to ourselves, we owe it to generations past, and we owe it to future generations.   That means that nationalism and egoism must never again be allowed to gain a foothold in Europe.   Rather, tolerance and solidarity are our common future.   Ladies and gentlemen, that is something absolutely worth striving for.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to the European Parliament, Strasbourg, 13 November 2018",2018-11-13,"Germany","A.Merkel",3291,"en"
"38","doc73501","Conference President Foreign Minister Bourita, Secretary-General, President of the General Assembly Maria Espinosa, Special Representative for International Migration Louise Arbour, Presidents, Colleagues, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be here with you in Marrakech today.   I would like to express my sincere thanks to our Moroccan hosts, as well as to the United Nations and to everyone else who has made this conference possible.   Today is a very important day.   For we are adopting a comprehensive political agreement on migration at global level for the first time.   The United Nations General Assembly was right to focus on two issues in 2016  -  on the one hand the topic of refugees, the legal basis of which is the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and on the other hand the topic of migration, an issue affecting millions of people throughout our world.   A clear distinction has been made here between refugees and migration, which is particularly significant.   That is why two Compacts have been drawn up as a result.   And both are to be adopted by the General Assembly before the end of December.   Today, on the 70 th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations General Assembly, it is particularly appropriate that we are also considering the fate of the many millions of migrants across the globe and reiterating our conviction that universal human rights apply to every individual in every country of the earth.   Ladies and gentlemen, today we are adopting this Compact, which expressly states that its focus is on safe, orderly and regular migration.   The very title of the Compact therefore describes its goal very specifically.   It has become clear, and it also makes sense that this goal can only be achieved through multilateral cooperation.   We could therefore say that 70 years after adoption of the International Bill of Human Rights it is high time that we also turned our joint attention to the issue of migration.   Migration is a natural and frequent occurrence, and it is a good thing when it takes place legally.   Germany is a member of the European Union.   Within the European Union we enjoy freedom of movement for the purposes of taking up employment.   That is one aspect of our single market, and it brings us greater prosperity.   That is why labour migration within the European Union is clearly regulated, also reflecting the principles of this Compact.   It is all about equal pay for the same work.   It is about reasonable standards.   All this is something we take for granted within the European Union.   Due to its demographic development, Germany is a country that in future will continue to require higher numbers of qualified experts, including more experts from countries outside the European Union.   We therefore have an interest in legal migration.   And what is in our interests is also subject to our sovereign right to self-determination.   The Compact states specifically that the Member States have the sovereign right to determine their own policies.   At the same time, the Compact is not legally binding.   So we will be reliant on legal migration as far as qualified experts are concerned and will need to talk to other countries about what is in our interests.   Nonetheless, we are aware that even within the context of legal migration as it exists in the world today, some people are exposed to extremely unfair working conditions.   Child labour is still a reality.   Dire working conditions are a reality.   The Compact tackles these issues.   And rightly so.   The Compact is also expressly intended to prevent and counter illegal migration.   It expresses the commitment to border management.   It expresses the commitment to fighting human trafficking.   It expresses the conviction that every individual should have adequate documentation.   And it raises the issue of the readmission of nationals residing illegally in another state.   We are all aware of the risks to which people who fall into the hands of human traffickers and smugglers are exposed.   I would like to take this opportunity to thank the International Organization for Migration, which will play a major role in connection with the implementation of this Compact, for its work, which it performs in many countries and which prevents many people from suffering an even worse fate.   We cannot allow human traffickers and smugglers to decide on whether someone from one country should enter another, robbing poor people of their money in the process.   Ultimately, this money is then used for drug trafficking or the purchasing of weapons, which in turn makes these countries even more unsafe.   Our goal must be for states themselves to regulate migration issues legally.   It is crucial that we join forces to fight illegal migration in the interests of our citizens.   It must be clear to everyone that states acting single-handedly will not be able to resolve this problem, but that it must be tackled through multilateral cooperation, and that this is indeed the only way to do so.   I would like to thank the Kingdom of Morocco specifically for the great responsibility it has assumed for migration issues within the African Union.   For the partnership between Europe and Africa is crucially important in implementing the goals of this Compact.   We all know that we will only be able to tackle illegal migration if all countries in the world have opportunities for development.   That is why the Compact goes hand in hand with implementation of the 2030 Agenda.   It has already been said here today that if the goals in the areas of education, health, security and nutrition are not achieved, neither will we manage to get to grips with illegal migration and truly put a stop to it.   That means that the development and implementation of this Compact and its content are inextricably linked.   And all countries of the world need to have fair development opportunities if we are to shape globalisation humanely.   Now we all know that illegal migration due to the unequal development opportunities in the world sparks considerable fear in our countries in some quarters.   These fears are exploited by opponents of the Compact to spread false rumours.   But in essence, all discussion of this Compact and whether or not it is the right approach centres around the principle of multilateral cooperation.   Ladies and gentlemen, it is worth reminding ourselves that the United Nations was founded as a result of the Second World War.   As German Chancellor, I stand here as a representative of a country that brought immeasurable suffering on humanity as a consequence of National Socialism.   The response to pure nationalism was the establishment of the United Nations and a commitment to work together to resolve the issues that concern us.   All debate surrounding this Compact  -  and that is why I made a very deliberate decision to come to Morocco today  -  concerns the very foundation of our international cooperation, no more and no less.   That is why it is worth fighting for this Compact  -  both because of the many people who will thereby be able to have a better life, and because of its clear commitment to multilateralism.   This is the only way that we will be able to make our world a better place.   Germany is committed to this task.   We have held intensive discussions in our parliament.   There was a large parliamentary majority in favour of supporting this Compact.   Germany will continue to play an active role in its further implementation for the benefit of the people on our planet.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in Marrakech on 10 December 2018",2018-12-10,"Germany","A.Merkel",1249,"en"
"39","doc73491","Distinguished guests, Excellencies, Citizens of the partner cities of Reims and Aachen, Esteemed students and pupils, President of the French Republic, Emmanuel, Ladies and gentlemen, Today is an important day for the Franco-German friendship.   With the Treaty of Aachen, we are renewing the foundation of cooperation between our countries.   We are reaffirming our intention to tackle the great challenges of our time side by side.   We are doing this in Aachen, the principle residence of Charlemagne, the one whom we call the Father of Europe.   We are doing this therefore in a place that stands both for the historic similarity between Germany and France and for the point of departure of very different paths of development.   We are signing this Treaty on the 56 th anniversary of the Élysée Treaty of 1963.   We are signing the Treaty of Aachen  -  a document that sets out the framework for our future cooperation.   Emmanuel Macron, just eight months ago you were awarded the Charlemagne Prize at this very spot  -  for your commitment to Europe, for your ideas for Europe and for your ideas regarding the cooperation between our two countries.   In view of the long era of rivalry and war between our countries, the fact that we are meeting like this today is not something that can be taken for granted.   We should keep on reminding ourselves of this fact.   It was only after the Second World War, which Germany brought to Europe during the National Socialist era, that we achieved understanding, reconciliation and ultimately friendship  -  a friendship that has now become deeply rooted in our societies.   History thus took a turn that could not have been any more fortunate for us.   We remember the foresight and determination of Konrad Adenauer and Charles de Gaulle.   They drove forward this process with the Élysée Treaty and made it irreversible.   We remember many other courageous politicians and masterminds who devoted themselves to the Franco-German friendship with all their might.   I would like to mention Valéry Giscard dEstaing and Helmut Schmidt here, as well as Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand.   Just as important are the thousands of mayors and leaders in our partner cities, those responsible for the 180 academic exchange programmes and the eight million people who have been given the opportunity to get to know each other over the years thanks to the Franco-German Youth Office.   Allow me to welcome representatives from all of these groups here today.   The fact that all of this came about was by no means something to be taken for granted.   It was by no means as easy as it sometimes appears today in retrospect.   The history of the origins and above all the ratification of the Élysée Treaty 56 years ago was a thorny path, to borrow a metaphor that was often employed at that time.   As a rose-grower, Konrad Adenauer knew what he was talking about.   And yet the Élysée Treaty helped to turn the Franco-German friendship into a unique relationship.   Why are we signing a new treaty today, supplemented by an agreement between our two parliaments, which will, in the future, work together in a structured manner in a parliamentary assembly consisting of 50 parliamentarians from each country? Why are we implementing the proposal made by French President Emmanuel Macron in his speech at the Sorbonne in September 2017 just 16 months down the line? We are doing so because we are living in exceptional times, and also because we need decisive, unambiguous, clear and forward-looking responses in this day and age.   On the one hand, the Europe of today can hardly be compared with that of 1963  -  neither in terms of the depth of integration nor as far as the number of its member states is concerned.   On the other hand, populism and nationalism are on the rise in all our countries.   The UKs withdrawal marks the first time that a country is leaving the EU.   Multilateralism is coming under fire around the world  -  whether in climate cooperation, world trade, the acceptance of international institutions, even the United Nations.   Seventy-four years  -  a lifetime  -  after the end of the Second World War, things that seemed to be self-evident are being called into question once again.   This is why we need, firstly, to recast our responsibility within the EU  -  the responsibility of Germany and France in this European Union.   This is why we need, secondly, to redefine the direction of our cooperation.   And thirdly, this is why we need a common understanding of our international role, one that can lead to joint action.   This is why, fourthly, we need common ground in the daily lives of our two peoples  -  in institutions, above all in the day-to-day coexistence of our peoples, and in the border region in particular.   The new Treaty, the Treaty of Aachen, consists of seven chapters and 28 articles.   We are very deliberately starting out with the chapter entitled ""European affairs"".   We are part of the European Union and we want to help ensure that it succeeds.   I am particularly grateful to the representatives of the European institutions, to you, Jean-Claude Juncker, to you, Donald Tusk, and to you, Klaus Iohannis, for being here today.   This reflects what we want to express with this Treaty.   The fact that the second chapter of the Treaty addresses questions of peace and security is also no coincidence.   Integrated into our common systems of collective security, we, Germany and France, pledge to offer one another any form of assistance and support that we can in the event of an armed attack on our respective territories.   This includes military means.   This sounds very simple and obvious, but it is not.   And so we discussed each and every word at length.   However, this is the necessary conclusion that we must draw from the breathtaking path that our peoples have trodden.   I would like to take this opportunity to thank the French President once again for inviting me to join the ceremonies commemorating the centenary of the end of the First World War.   We visited Compiègne, the place where the armistice was signed in 1918.   The journey from that day to this, to our commitment to help each other, is simply breathtaking.   We are grateful that we were able to make this journey.   We are committed to developing a common military culture, a common defence industry and a common approach to arms exports.   In so doing, we intend to help to create a European army.   This will only work, however, if this goes hand in hand with efforts to coordinate our foreign policy.   Those who are aware of the many things that happen each day also know what it means when we commit together now to assuming foreign policy responsibility and to standing up for our interests.   However, this will only work if we improve the way in which we coordinate our development policy.   Our neighbouring continent of Africa is a particularly important part of this.   This Treaty is about our future, and this applies to the fields of culture, education, research and mobility, as well as to sustainable development, climate and environmental protection and economic affairs.   France and Germany want to and must set the pace in the areas of the future that are key to the prosperity of our European Union.   We know that we can only safeguard social cohesion if we are economically successful, if education plays a key role and if our culture accords us the freedom we need.   We also know that time is of the essence and that the world does not sleep.   Europe has been unable to keep its promise from the year 2000 to become the worlds leading continent.   We must catch up in many areas.   Our resolve to complete the European internal market is part of this.   We must create a digital single market, and we must coordinate our research areas, in particular in the field of artificial intelligence.   We must develop common platforms.   These are just a few examples of the wide range of tasks that lie before us.   Achieving the integration towards a Franco-German economic area with common rules, an objective stated by the Treaty, involves a great deal of work that remains to be done.   This entails harmonising legislation in the respective areas.   We want to consider the future of work together.   We are capable of doing so much more to coordinate our labour market policy.   Only in this way will we be able to achieve our objective, namely convergence between our economies.   Driving the energy transition forward is part of this, of course.   We are all aware of our different positions with respect to nuclear energy, renewable energies and coal.   This is therefore a major task.   The border regions are to play a pioneering role in this common area of coexistence.   I believe this to be a welcome chapter in this Treaty.   From a French perspective, this is perhaps even an unusual chapter, because we, as federalists, are aware, of course, that we have Minister-Presidents in Germany who have at least as much say as the Federal Government.   France is structured differently, however.   It is no coincidence that we are here in Aachen today  -  in a city that not only stands for the history of our two countries, but also for the many cities in the border regions along our almost 500 km-long border.   The people in these regions should develop new forms of cooperation.   They should tell us about their experiences and will be accorded special room for manoeuvre.   They can change administrative regulations.   You know what it means if not everyone who is generally responsible pays attention to such matters.   Ladies and gentlemen, these are only some objectives that we have set for ourselves.   I believe that the Treaty of Aachen constitutes an excellent framework for this.   However  -  and we must remind ourselves of this today  -  this does not mean that our work is done.   Life must be breathed into the Treaty  -  day by day.   I know from my own experience how sluggish our responses to new challenges often are, how determinedly decisions are postponed and how often we claim that something is not possible right now.   That is why the question as to whether this Treaty is based on the desire to bring it to life is crucial.   On behalf of the Federal Government, especially on behalf of my colleagues who are here today, and also on behalf of those who are unable to be here today, allow me to say this: yes, we have an unswerving desire to do just that.   I know that our federal states see this in just the same way.   I know that countless organisations are waiting precisely for a signal such as this in order to be able to further Franco-German cooperation in the spirit of Europe.   We will have to work hard to ensure that we continue to understand each other even better, not only linguistically, but also mentally and organisationally, that we treat each other out of respect for our different cultures and perceive this to be an enrichment of our own culture, and that we can get as many people on board as possible.   I am aware that this is an arduous task.   However, infinite enrichment lies at the end of this path.   I would like to pledge here  -  and also on behalf of the entire Federal Government  -  that we will do this with all our heart and soul.   Long live the Franco-German friendship! - - - -","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the signing of the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on Franco‑German Cooperation and Integration in Aachen on 22 January 2019",2019-01-22,"Germany","A.Merkel",1914,"en"
"40","doc73481","Julia, Ministers, Commissioners, State Secretaries, On behalf of the entire Federal Government, I would like to welcome you to this special event here at the International Green Week in Berlin.   The fact that so many of you have come here shows the willingness to work together and to tap into the agricultural sectors innovation potential.   As has already been said, the Global Forum for Food and Agriculture is also active as a platform in multilateral endeavours as a whole, ranging from Argentinas to Japans G20 Presidencies.   I have heard that you work together very amicably and demonstrate a very high level of flexibility as regards negotiations.   That is always important.   Allow me to say that we are trying to be good hosts.   Davos for the agricultural sector  -  all that is missing is the snow and the mountains.   But we try to make up for this with other things in Berlin.   The city has a great deal to offer, although I admit that you wont find many agricultural firms here.   But for those of you who cannot go a whole day without agriculture, a visit to Domäne Dahlem is an option, even if this open-air agricultural museum is relatively small.   But here at the International Green Week, you can certainly see enough agriculture.   As regards food, your focus is on food security and the fight to eradicate hunger, that is, on an issue that also plays a key role in the SDGs, the Sustainable Development Goals for 2030.   A world without hunger is one of the express aims.   You use innovation potential to connect things that seem mutually exclusive, namely food security with a growing world population and at times overuse of our resources.   When it comes to these challenges, digital technology fundamentally offers us far more opportunities than reasons to fear.   But as always, if the focus is to remain on people, we need guidance, regulations and a framework in order to safeguard legal certainty and justice.   You have come to Germany.   In this country, and probably in your own, too, many farmers wonder what impact structural change, extreme weather, low prices and trade disputes will have on their future.   Every farm is also a home.   It is very much bound up with emotions, but at the same time, it has to function as a business.   That is why we need to work together on this area so that we combine the sustainable use of nature, of our planet, to put it rather more dramatically, with the need to function as a business.   We have many opportunities.   Agricultural professions in particular can become extremely appealing thanks to digital transformation.   I know that start-ups are also attending this event.   One of the opportunities, naturally, is that hard physical labour will no longer be required.   Robots can already do a great deal in dairy sheds.   I had a chance to see that for myself last summer.   Farm-management systems can make bookkeeping and planning easier.   This means we can already see in some farms today  -  and not only in large ones  -  what the future will look like.   We in Germany are trying to focus on smaller and medium-sized farms.   In that context, I have to think about the European Commissioners.   Naturally, we are following everything that is being discussed in the Commission.   I come from a region where larger farms are more common.   In other regions, farms tend to be small.   However, I dont want to bore you now with internal EU discussions.   Technical progress is being made in leaps and bounds.   For example, every second cow in Northwest Europe will probably be milked by robots by 2025.   Digital developments are often achieved even faster.   Nevertheless, I think it will be a major problem for us in Germany at any rate to provide support for the generation change.   But the better the material and economic situation is in farms, the faster innovations will catch on.   In order for farmers to be able to make use of the opportunities afforded by digital technology in the first place, however, we need to install high-tech digital infrastructure.   We still have a lot to do in Germany in this regard.   But I imagine that things are no different in other countries.   Julia Klöckner, our Federal Minister of Food and Agriculture, is highly committed when it comes to connecting rural regions to the internet  -  and not just to any sort of internet, but naturally to high-speed internet as soon as possible.   However, as we see that this does not work in rural regions through market-economy forces alone, we need to provide state support.   Precision agriculture, to which I will return later on, is a classic example of how it is not enough simply for a farmhouse to have an internet connection.   Farmers need internet access throughout areas measuring many hectares.   That is why this is a major topic, as otherwise there would be no need to talk about digital transformation in large sectors.   The traditional sector of agriculture must therefore  -  this is Germanys policy at any rate and I think it is the same in almost all countries  -  be firmly rooted in our countries economic and value-added policies.   The agricultural sector also plays a role in preserving the landscape and culture.   It plays a part in renewable resources and naturally in food supply.   According to United Nations estimates, an additional two to three billion people will have to be fed by 2050.   That means agriculture will have to produce around two-thirds more.   But even today, we have not yet managed to banish hunger from the world.   It is therefore becoming increasingly important that we find new paths, also in order to prevent ecological damage or, in cases where farming is still not ecological, to change this.   Food production can and must be increased, particularly in countries that we commonly refer to as ""developing countries"".   That is why we must improve various things.   The first thing we need to improve is access to markets and resources.   We also need to make investment conditions better in general.   Those of us who live in Europe have our own problems with this.   However, I have also looked in depth at the situation in African countries.   When you see the interest rates on loans and how difficult it is to get a loan in the first place, you realise that people face huge problems there.   Although it does not directly involve agriculture, that is why we launched an initiative called Compact with Africa during our G20-Presidency in which we encourage countries to make their financial parameters more transparent and to work with the World Bank and IMF.   In return, we are improving access to loans and working with the African Development Bank.   I think this is very important, as countries cannot allow themselves to become dependent in a way that creates good prospects for perhaps two or three years, but then leaves them in debt and unable to generate sustainable development.   Good governance is vital for good cooperation.   You are here as representatives of your countries.   If I may take the liberty of saying so, many countries have very different problems to those we face in Europe.   The average age is increasing in Europe, whereas in Asia and even more so in Africa, there is an incredibly high percentage of young people, all of whom want to have a future.   These young people often have a smartphone before they have permanent access to electricity.   If they have a smartphone, then they know what is possible in the world.   These young people want to have a say and to be part of an active civil society.   That is why I would like to ask you not to fear an active civil society, but rather to make use of the opportunity that people can have a say and determine their own lives.   Naturally, people also want security as regards their property rights.   And we must do everything we can to create and safeguard social peace.   Secondly, as well as improving access to markets and resources, modern, environmentally responsible methods adapted to regional needs are required in order to boost production and productivity.   Innovation is needed to meet increasing demand.   I am aware that many countries that still have, so to speak, very family-oriented and low-tech farming, are now facing an enormous leap forward.   Even if we use development aid to teach people the latest farming methods and show them the best machinery, there are still often conflicts over fields.   And questions arise such as whether it is possible to work with a neighbour and their machinery, that is, to merge land, the best way to do this and the risks entailed.   This will involve an enormous cultural process in many areas.   We need to face up to digital transformation.   Weather forecasts are the easiest part of this.   Information is available online about new cultivation methods and pest control.   What is also very important is that people can compare prices.   They cannot be blackmailed by just anyone.   Instead, they can use their internet access to look up prices.   Direct marketing becomes far more straightforward.   AMIS, the G20 Agricultural Market Information System, has become a pretty good instrument for making harvest forecasts and prices for rice, corn, wheat and soya more transparent and helping to curb price fluctuations, thus preventing famine to a certain extent.   None of this  -  and that, too, is becoming apparent  -  can be achieved without international cooperation.   Those who believe they can resolve all these issues for their country on their own and cheat others will end in abysmal failure.   I firmly believe that.   That is why it is so important that your event is also a good example of international cooperation.   Naturally, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.   The problems are completely different, not only between countries in the North and South for example, but also in the countries themselves, as I already showed, using Germany as an example.   That means we need to find solutions for small, medium and huge farms.   Naturally, we also need to ensure that we preserve biodiversity and the ability of soil and ecosystems to regenerate.   If we look at the species extinction that can be seen worldwide, we see it is a huge topic, including here in Germany.   Climate change is reaching ever-larger parts of the world.   Africans have known for a long time what this means in their countries, particularly in the Sahel.   But here in Germany, too, we are also seeing that climate change is having a huge impact on conditions.   This is not shown by a single summer, but in the meantime we can definitely see how certain types of plants no longer thrive in some regions in Germany the way they did a century ago.   That is why we can already say that climate change is the ecological challenge of our era.   And that is why we also want to do our utmost to ensure that we can adhere to the Paris Climate Agreement.   Sustainable agriculture will be one element in this.   The aim is to limit global warming to 1.  5 degrees Celsius or less.   However, we must honestly say that not all sectors can make the same contribution.   For the agricultural sector, for example, it is not so easy to reduce CO 2 emissions, particularly in animal farming.   We now have very interesting research methods that show how food and CO 2 emissions are connected.   We still have a long way to go.   If we say that economies must be almost entirely decarbonised by the end of this century, this means agriculture is one of the sectors that will have to play a part here until the end.   Another important question, one that is a huge concern for us with regard to large parts of the world, is our approach to our forests.   As long as wood is still needed for heating, there can be no talk of ecological sustainability.   That is why the topic of renewable energies and agriculture is naturally extremely important.   Intensive farming, involving a high nitrogen input and the extensive use of pesticides, is of course also a problem.   Precision agriculture is the ideal solution here.   Digital technology, which can be both a curse and a boon, fosters individualisation all over the world.   In some cases, we no longer reach people at all because everyone has their own sources of information where they exchange views.   At the same time, this technology enables us to look at each and every plant and to enter information on specific plants, thus reducing the need for fertilisers and making forecasts possible.   When artificial intelligence and its forecasting methods are added to the mix, we will be able to do absolutely wonderful things that still seem very unlikely to us today.   Julia Klöckner just told me how certain pests can be detected at an early stage and how individual plants can be fertilised.   Naturally, that is something I very much welcome.   If drones make precision farming possible, consumers stand to benefit in the end.   Of course, digital technology also affects all kinds of marketing methods.   This can help to prevent the losses that occur even in countries where sadly many people still do not have enough to eat.   Naturally, we also point out the risks.   You do the same thing when you ask who owns data and who is responsible for it.   Whoever controls data will essentially decide in the future where value-added will be generated, as whoever holds the data will be able to set the prices.   That is why we also need to create rules on competition in the data sector.   We need to put security measures in place for users.   We also hear a lot of complaints in Europe  -  I say this very frankly  -  because we sometimes tend to choose bureaucratic solutions.   But fundamentally, our General Data Protection Regulation, with certain security aims, is really of the utmost importance.   We also need to find a global solution here.   And you, who have come here in such great numbers today, will play a role in this.   On the one hand, therefore, you are in the midst of an enormous development with huge potential and, if we think about what things were like 50 years ago, fantastic and scarcely conceivable possibilities.   On the other hand, however, you are also in the midst of a development in which people who have nothing whatsoever to do with agriculture may end up owning all of the relevant data merely because they run a platform, thus enabling them to take over a large part of value-added from the agricultural sector.   This forum is very helpful as regards finding the right balance between seeing the needs of the agricultural sector and putting the focus on people who work in this sector.   That is why I was very happy to come here and to pay what you might call an unorthodox visit to the International Green Week.   Julia Klöckner commended this forum to me and I am very glad that I accepted the invitation.   I hope that you will have excellent discussions, produce a good final communiqué and make good progress.   And in the brief time that your host may allot you for leisure activities, I hope you will have a chance to enjoy the German capital, Berlin.   It has been a privilege to speak to you.   Thank you very much indeed.    -","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the Global Forum for Food and Agriculture in Berlin on 18 January 2019",2019-01-23,"Germany","A.Merkel",2580,"en"
"41","doc73471","Professor Schwab, Ladies and gentlemen, Im glad to be back in Davos again today.   And its my impression that the snow looks more beautiful this year, rather than worse.   I am delighted to greet you all  -  in particular those of my Cabinet colleagues whom I can see in the audience  -  and let me say that Germany is back with a stable government and that, after a rocky start, we are all willing to work together constructively.   You have picked a topic that is of paramount interest, namely shaping the global architecture for the fourth industrial revolution.   Your discussions will be influenced by two things, one of them being the Global Risks Report which is published before each Davos Forum, and which reminds us we face many significant challenges.   Let me mention climate change and natural disasters, for example, as well as cyber attacks and associated challenges, and terrorist attacks.   At the same time, there are numerous disturbances and uncertainties in the multilateral system.   Taken together with the general challenges, this has also resulted in the lowering of growth forecasts by the International Monetary Fund.   This gives rise to a situation in which I think it can fairly be said that this Forum can play its part in bringing more security into the system, instead of allowing insecurities to grow further after this discussion.   For I think there are many people who want to strengthen the multilateral order.   If we look at the global architecture at the start of the 21 st century, we see that it is still based in its essence on the actions taken following the end of World War II.   We have the United Nations and we have other formats such as the G7, and the G20 set up later at the level of Heads of State and Government in response to one of the major crises which was ultimately also already influenced by the digital transformation, namely the big banking crisis of more than ten years ago.   If were honest, were still feeling the repercussions of that crisis.   It caused an incredible loss of confidence  -  in politics, but also in the economic sphere, particularly in the financial sector.   The regulations we introduced  -  to better control the banks  -  were a step forward, but if you ask people in our countries, you will find that their belief in a stable international financial sector has been damaged quite significantly.   Therefore we have to do everything to avoid a repetition of the crisis.   If we look at the interest-rate policies of the major central banks, its obvious that we are still chewing on this crisis, that we are not yet out of the woods, and that we have limited our own room for manoeuvre in the future in the course of this crisis.   This makes it all the more important to get back to normality as quickly as possible.   Secondly, we have major international organisations, such as the World Trade Organization, and these are beneficial to progress.   This international architecture  -  the United Nations with all its subsidiary organisations, the International Labour Organisation, the World Bank and the IMF, as well as the OECD  -  have helped make the world a better place all in all.   Notwithstanding all the problems, I would like to remind us that when the World Economic Forum was established in 1971, the global population was 3.  8 billion, and 60 percent of the population lived in extreme poverty.   The planet is now home to 7.  6 billion people, and only 10 percent of them now live in extreme poverty.   Thats still 700 to 800 million people, its true, but it marks a reduction both in absolute numbers and as a percentage.   One of the bright spots among our international decisions was, for example, the adoption of the SDGs, the development goals for 2030, and the fact that the international community has for example pledged to end extreme poverty by 2030.   I am confident we will achieve this goal.   The Global Compact for Migration and the Global Compact on Refugees which were adopted by the United Nations with relative unanimity are further bright spots.   However, these two compacts also illustrated how the international order is currently under pressure and is being cast into doubt.   If we ask why this is the case, and look to the history of mankind for our answers, we find that the decisions underlying todays architecture were taken roughly 74 years ago.   That is, as it were, a lifetime ago.   We have to be careful not to casually dispense with the knowledge and insights of the people who were in charge in the immediate aftermath of the terrors of World War II.   Because back then those in charge drew what I believe to be the right conclusions, for example by establishing the United Nations.   However, we have also seen that international organisations are very slow to adopt institutional reforms.   Just think how many years it took us to implement the quota reform at the IMF or to increase the capital of the World Bank.   These changes were urgently needed because emerging market economies such as China and India had long since had a greatly increased impact on our world economy.   If an existing system reacts far too slowly to change, the result is that other players make themselves felt, for example by establishing new institutions.   Thats what has happened several times.   The fact that there is now an Asian Investment Bank alongside the existing G20 format and the World Bank, the fact that there is also a Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which brings together China, India, Russia and other countries, and the fact that China is promoting a 16+1 format to work with parts of the European Union, this is, I believe, a warning shot which should tell us  -  or tell me, as an example of a western politician  -  that we have to do something to stop the fragmentation of the international architecture, that we have to be ready to reform the existing institutions to reflect the true balance of power in the world.   Of course we also know the world is currently very much divided on the question of how to move forward.   In my opinion, we must not beat around the bush.   If we want to reform existing institutions which set global benchmarks then we have to be on board and we have to accept the balance of power as it now is.   However, another mindset is now also represented on the world stage, one which harbours basic doubts about multilateralism and which claims that the world works best if everyone thinks of themselves and puts their own interests first, and then an order will emerge which is good for everyone.   I have my doubts.   I think we should always understand our national interests in such a way that we factor in other countries vested interests, and thereby create the win-win situations that are the prerequisite for multilateral action.   I see myself in the tradition, if you like, of the great sociologist Max Weber, whom I revere, who exactly 100 years ago spoke about the ""ethic of responsibility"" for politicians in his ""Politics as a Vocation"", setting us guidelines and making the point that compromise is the result of responsible action on the part of politicians.   When I hear, as I often do nowadays, that compromise is something that is not to be accepted, something bad, something negative, then I would like to respond unequivocally that no global architecture will function unless we are all able to compromise.   Even now, we are finding it difficult to reform and update the present system with its global institutions.   But the question asked here at the World Economic Forum goes even further: We are now faced with disruptive developments, with a fourth industrial revolution  -  what does that mean for the architecture we have today? I for one stand before you as someone who values multilateralism and multilateral institutions and believes them to be indispensable if the world is to thrive.   The key question is therefore where can we really set new benchmarks now? In this regard, I could now make a somewhat tongue-in-cheek but nevertheless very serious comment: some things do still work out.   On 16 November  -  I dont know whether you noticed  -  a revolution took place in Versailles, France.   The General Conference on Weights and Measures was held.   As a result of this conference, the old kilogram, the ampere and other units will become obsolete and measurements will be redefined by natural constants.   This truly is a revolution in the world of weights and measures.   The international community came together to agree on this reform.   On 20 May 2019, new definitions for all base units will become effective.   As of that date, the prototype of the kilogram of 1889 will no longer shrink and well always have a kilogram which has been clearly quantified.   That should encourage us to carry on striving for reform and to engage with the ideas of the modern age.   The first major challenge that should be mentioned here is how we deal with data, how we evaluate data and how we clarify the ownership of data.   Were grappling with these questions in all areas.   Secondly, in the world of big data, weve experienced a huge leap forward in the sphere of artificial intelligence.   Here our task will be to put ethical guidelines in place.   Thirdly, Id like to mention the possibilities of genetic engineering and bioethical issues.   Here too, we dont yet have any global agreements.   We have to find answers to these pressing questions.   As yet, I dont see a global architecture to deal with them.   However, I cannot imagine that every major economic power is going to find different answers.   Just look at the two major poles when it comes to data processing.   On the one hand, we have the United States.   There, data is largely in the hands of private stakeholders.   That makes it difficult to set down guidelines which determine limits.   My view is that the rules we had in the analogue world cannot be simply cast aside in the digital world.   Rather, we need clear guidelines here, too.   On the other hand, we have China.   There the state has extensive access to all data  -  even personal data.   Neither of these two very different approaches is in line with my own ideas or those which influenced Germany with its social market economy, ideas that include the protection of privacy.   For all its imperfections, the European Union set down guidelines on how to better regulate personal data with the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation.   That takes some effort; however, when the Industrial Revolution took place and people moved from the countryside into the cities, it was probably also difficult for them to carry around different sets of keys to open their own doors.   These are civilisational developments which we have to go through.   I therefore believe that we should certainly strive to protect a certain degree of privacy.   Were also faced with the major issue of fair taxation in the digital world.   Im very much in favour of the proposals currently being drawn up in the OECD, and I believe that we can achieve greater fairness and clarity in the sphere of taxation if we combine minimal taxation with what the G20 Finance Ministers have come up with  -  the BEPS system.   Of course, we shouldnt by any means leave this to chance.   Since our difficulties with the NSA back in 2014 or 2013, Germany has tried time and again in the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council to sponsor resolutions aimed at addressing the privacy of data in the digital age.   North and South are working well together, as you might say, for Germany and Brazil are trying in cooperation with Mexico, Austria and many others to define ever more clearly how to move forward in this sphere.   But I cannot deny that this has been a laborious process.   I was delighted when my Japanese colleague Shinzō Abe said here today that he would like to use Japans G20 Presidency to focus on data and to launch global data governance.   I believe the G20 is a very good format in which to place this issue on the agenda of the largest industrialised nations on a comprehensive scale.   Naturally, its only possible for Europe or Germany to take part in the debate on what a global architecture should look like if we are a major player, if we are an economically strong player that is in a position to enforce ethical measures.   For the reality is that you can only have an impact internationally if you are economically strong and able not only to analyse the problems and to provide moral guidance but also to speak from your own experience.   Coming back to my own country, to Germany, I can tell you that we still have a strong economy which, however, has been shaped to a very large degree by the industrial age.   In our country, the manufacturing sector still produces much of our wealth.   And the automotive industry certainly still plays a very important role in this generation of our wealth.   If we look at the revolutionary development in the automotive sector then, of course, we can see there are potential risks: risks in terms of jobs; risks in terms of data management.   For example, the question as to who owns data is of crucial importance.   If, as it were, data always belongs to platforms then our prospects are less favourable than if they belong to the car manufacturers themselves.   The fact that we in Germany, for instance, but also in Europe, arent able to this very day to produce battery cells ourselves is certainly a major problem for Europes future as a car manufacturing base.   Thats why I remain convinced that we should make policy decisions concerning this industry  -  as weve already done in the case of chip manufacturing  -  and use our cooperation in Europe to close the gap in areas of technology where weve fallen behind.   For I believe that we cannot simply leave a large portion of the value added in relation to tomorrows cars, for example in the sphere of e-mobility, to other continents if we want to be a competitive player on a durable basis.   Germany faces three challenges of considerable importance to our future, which Id like to mention here.   First of all, the energy transition  -  the issue of affordable but also sustainable energy which meets our climate protection objectives.   Im quite certain  -  and this, after all, is becoming more evident from year to year  -  that climate change is of huge importance to us and to the world as a whole.   Industrialised countries therefore have a responsibility to develop technology which can also benefit others.   Thats not because the CO 2 emissions of 80 million people, as in Germanys case, could have a great impact on overall global emissions.   Rather, its because we have the capability to do so and because we have already emitted so much CO 2 in the course of industrialisation.   Im therefore very happy to be able to say to you  -  even though it has an impact on our energy prices  -  that renewable energy is now the cornerstone of our energy supply in Germany and accounts for the largest percentage in our overall energy mix.   We will have phased out nuclear energy by 2022.   We have a very difficult problem, namely that almost the only sources of energy that will be able to provide baseload power are coal and lignite.   Germany has now phased out its own coal production.   That means that subsidies have been discontinued.   Lignite isnt subsidised and is thus a relatively cheap but very CO2 2 -intensive source of energy.   Weve therefore set up a commission which is examining the phasing-out of coal-based power in Germany and is now in the final stage of its work.   Naturally, we cannot do without baseload energy.   Natural gas will therefore play a greater role for another few decades.   The dispute about where our natural gas comes from is thus a bit over the top.   For, on the one hand, its perfectly clear that well continue to obtain natural gas from Russia.   However, it goes without saying that we want to diversify.   Well therefore also purchase liquid gas  -  perhaps from the United States and other sources.   Were thus expanding infrastructure in all directions.   However, I believe we would be well advised to admit that if we phase out coal and nuclear energy then we have to be honest and tell people that well need more natural gas.   Whats more, energy has to be affordable.   This brings us to a subject on which we in the coalition have resolved to do better.   For, being honest, I have to say that compared with elsewhere in the world, we are far too slow with construction projects.   We are too slow when it comes to the expansion of the grid  -  the generation of renewable energy requires entirely different transmission structures.   We are too slow when it comes to our infrastructure as a whole.    -  I see our Infrastructure Minister here.    -  Our aim must be to become quicker, obviously without neglecting the rule of law.   The second point is digitisation.   Here, too, it is a matter of infrastructure  -  but of very much more besides.   One thing that particularly worries me  -  and this is something else we can only resolve at European level  -  is that we have fallen far behind in the platform economy.   Maybe its the case that countries with a fairly saturated and relatively well-functioning administration do not feel such a drive to innovate as developing countries and emerging economies do.   In particular, nothing the state does with its citizens is anywhere near as digitised as it should be.   So we plan to ensure that all administrative services are available to our citizens in digital form as well, by 2022 at the latest.   Here, too, though, we really are not up with the frontrunners at European level.   Were actually a bit behind.   I think the digital transformation is going really well in our big companies.   Things are getting better in SMEs; B2B is working really quite well.   But business-to-customer is where it all unravels.   Here we are in a competition.   That is absolutely clear.   And it is a competition that will decide whether those who operate the platform or those who offer the product gain the value added, as it were.   I dont think this battle is over, certainly not from the German perspective.   We can win it, but we will have to be fast.   The third point is demographic change in Germany.   Here, freedom of movement within the European Union is a big help.   But on top of this we in Germany have now decided  -  after decades of discussion, it has to be said  -  to adopt an immigration act for skilled workers.   Of course, this also means that we will have to manage migration better.   Here, too, though, we have made considerable progress in recent years.   We have seen, ladies and gentlemen,  -  and here Im adding a fourth point  -  that we can only truly move forwards if we stop believing that we can go it alone.   The war in Syria and terrorism in Iraq have shown us how globalisation is reaching us in Europe and especially in Germany too, in the form of many refugee flows.   That is why I am very proud to be able to say that Germany is one of the major donors helping to bring stability to the arc comprising Syria, Jordan and Lebanon.   For we know that it is much better if people can stay in their home countries and not fall into the hands of human traffickers.   Our development, too, goes better, if we provide help on the spot.   That is why our focus will be on this region, but also on partnership with Africa.   That is why we did so much with Africa during our G20 presidency.   Let me say this once again: from the European perspective, Africa is often regarded as a problem continent.   But if we take a look at how Africa, a huge continent which will have two billion inhabitants in 2050, is gradually expanding multilateral cooperation and strengthening its African Union and regional associations, at how it intends to introduce freedom of movement and at how it has a clear idea of future infrastructure projects, then we also have to regard Africa as a continent of opportunities.   This applies particularly to us Europeans, Africas neighbours.   And so a clear commitment to multilateralism, even if it takes courage, is a fundamental prerequisite for our policymaking.   It is also well worth bringing together like-minded countries across the world.   Because anything else will end in misery.   With this in mind, Germany sees its future firmly within the European Union.   Because the European Union can generate the necessary energy to move things forward.   However, we are now having to come to terms with the shock of the United Kingdom wanting to leave the EU.   I am directing all my thoughts and energies to finding an orderly solution in which we can have a good partnership for the benefit of all.   We are absolutely dependent on cooperation with the British in matters relating to internal security, external security and defence.   But we are also a trade area  -  and the closer and the less complicated our relations are, the better.   But of course this is also up to the UK.   Within the European Union, we have always championed free trade.   And I am pleased that the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement is entering into force on 1 February.   We are also committed to trade talks with the United States of America.   We have concluded the trade talks with Canada.   And I believe more should follow  -  with Singapore and Australia, if possible also MERCOSUR and others.   Ladies and gentlemen, we in Europe have decided to take the huge step of saying that in future we also want to combine our defence capabilities.   This is also a question of our vision of ourselves.   This joint strategic agreement to consider defence policy together is not directed against NATO.   In fact, it can make things easier for NATO, because today we have over 170 different defence systems or weapons systems.   The US has, I believe, fewer than 60.   You can imagine the resulting loss in efficiency with respect to training and maintenance.   Germany and Frances decision to build combat aircraft together in future, to build tanks together, is, of course, a very important strategic decision  -  just as yesterdays signing of the Treaty of Aachen between Germany and France as the continuation of the Élysée Treaty is a commitment, a commitment in an age of many uncertainties.   It is a commitment that says yes, we want to play our part as important partners in Europe and to further develop the European Union.   Yesterday I found it very moving that not only did the French President and the German Chancellor sign a treaty, but that this was done in the presence of the Commission President, the President of the European Council and the rotating Romanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.   This was intended to make it very clear that we want to help to strengthen Europe.   But let me tell you that, for historical reasons, we Germans do still have our difficulties with multilateralism.   Agreeing arms export guidelines with France, for example, is a huge task.   But it has to be done, because no-one will want to develop weapons systems with us if they are not sure they can sell them later.   In other words, and I want to say this unequivocally, it is not the case that I always find multilateralism easy because it is always easy.   On the contrary: it is difficult.   But then I always have to ask myself: what is the alternative, and what will it mean? We can see it in all of our countries: the challenges posed by populism, the emergence of nationalist forces.   We have to square up to these challenges.   But perhaps that makes the battle lines clearer and stronger.   That is why I and my colleagues in the German cabinet will champion a multilateral order which does not end at the European Union, but which is capable of giving really good responses to the new global challenges.   However, that means that we must take care not to ruin the existing order so much that no-one believes in the validity of new parameters any more.   So I am delighted to have had the opportunity to speak to you on this note today.   Thank you.   - - -","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the 49th World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos on 23 January 2019",2019-01-28,"Germany","A.Merkel",4141,"en"
"42","doc73461","Ms Schmider, Mr Philipp, Mr Bader, Mr Schmidt, Ms Amanpour, Ambassador Grenell, Ladies and gentlemen, Members of the Fulbright community, Esteemed guests, This is a moving moment.   I would like to thank you for  -  in some cases  -  making a very long journey to pay tribute to me here and thus in part also to Germany.   You have choreographed this event in a wonderful way.   In Mr Pauser, someone from my constituency is here with us.   Greifswald is part of this constituency.   There are truly moving stories about how it is possible today that a town  -  admittedly, a venerable Hanseatic town, but all the same, a town in Western Pomerania  -  is embedded in the world.   Then of course, we had the welcome from Renée Fleming, whose voice means so much to me.   It is wonderful to have her here with us too.   And I would also like to thank you for your kind words, my dear Ms Amanpour.   We normally only see each other on television and mostly from a distance.   Thank you for being here today and for explaining my political work.   The Fulbright Prize shows how important international understanding is.   As one would say in mathematics, understanding alone is not enough, but it is necessary, for peaceful coexistence, on both a small and large scale.   As a young scholarship student in Oxford, William Fulbright experienced for himself how empathy and trust can ultimately be created across borders and continents when people meet and listen to each other.   On the basis of this experience, he launched a programme shortly after the Second World War that is one of the most successful exchange programmes we have to this day.   I think that we need to keep picturing this time shortly after the end of the Second World War.   It was actually a time when we could have expected hatred and ill will to gain the upper hand.   However, there were people  -  and we benefit from their work to this day  -  who made reconciliation and understanding possible in this situation, which was catastrophic for Germans because of what they had caused.   Understanding and empathy can be fostered by countries and programmes, but they cannot be prescribed.   That is why we always need people who are open to others and to their views and experiences.   We need school pupils, students, professors and professionals of all kinds who have the courage to be open to new things, to learn foreign languages, and to live, work and create a life for themselves in other countries.   What an achievement it is when that succeeds, particularly if new acquaintances become new friends.   Such experiences have a life-long impact.   They promote openness towards other cultures, affinity with other countries, and a sense of gratitude for having had the opportunity to broaden ones horizons.   When you are somewhere else, you can no longer hold tight to your prejudices, but instead have to live with reality.   As we all know, it is far more difficult to say certain things to someones face than to say them from a distance.   Now in particular, I think such experiences must be put back on the agenda and discussed among us, as those who are open to other countries and people are perceived there as ambassadors who personify life in their home country.   Conversely, those who return home bring with them a wealth of newly acquired experiences, which they can share with others.   This means that each and every successful exchange helps our countries to learn about and understand one another.   Every contact and friendship forms a link in the chain of international relations.   Senator Fulbright firmly believed in such citizen diplomacy  -  in the idea that it is not only politicians and diplomats who foster peace, but above all citizens who establish and maintain friendly relations with people in other countries.   It is so easy to say this.   But a great cultural achievement, one that Americans and Germans in particular constantly demonstrate, is behind this open-mindedness.   For example, many US citizens regard Germany as a second home.   In Berlin alone, there are some 20,000 Americans.   There are 10,000 German students at US universities and even more young Americans, namely 12,600 people, studying here in Germany.   Americans and Germans study, research and work together.   In this way, they breathe life into and renew our relations every day.   The Fulbright Program plays a crucial role in this.   The exchange with Germany is particularly intensive.   To date, the Fulbright Commission has awarded over 46,000 grants to Germans and Americans, thus showing the great mutual interest between the two countries.   It is certainly no coincidence that the United States and Germany are united by partnership and friendship  -  and have been for over 70 years now.   The Fulbright Program started as far back as 1946, only a year after the end of the Second World War.   That year, then US Secretary of State James Francis Byrnes gave a speech in Germany  -  this was in 1946  -  that ended as follows and I quote: ""The American people want to return the government of Germany to the German people.   The American people want to help the German people to win their way back to an honourable place among the free and peace-loving nations of the world.  "" These words became known as the ""speech of hope""  -  hope for a future for a country that had been destroyed by a war it had unleashed itself; hope for a country whose statehood, economy and ethical principles lay in ruins.   But why should this country, a former enemy that had caused so much suffering in the world, be helped to a better future? There was no lack of understandable concerns and doubts.   But thanks to extraordinary courage and political foresight, such help was provided.   Germany was to take its fate back into its own hands.   It was to build up a democracy.   It was to become a partner that was part of a free and flourishing European reality.   Our country thus had the privilege of experiencing how important faith and trust are.   That is what the United States and the other Western Allies gave Germany, in word and deed.   The Fulbright Program expresses this.   I would also like to take this opportunity to recall the Marshall Plan and the many Allied soldiers who were stationed in Germany during the Cold War.   Let us recall the Berlin Airlift, which brought vital supplies to the blockaded city 70 years ago and kept its hope for freedom alive.   And we shall never forget the legendary show of support from US President John F.   Kennedy who said ""Ich bin ein Berliner.  "" 9 November 2019 will mark the thirtieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.   We are gathered here in a symbolic venue, close to the Brandenburg Gate.   This gate, which was closed for decades and has now been open for almost 30 years, is a symbol of Berlins freedom, German reunification, the end of the division of Europe and the fact that all this could be achieved because our US friends tirelessly supported a free Europe and made this Europe strong.   We Germans will not forget this.   When I was in Washington recently for a sad occasion, the funeral of George Bush, we had an opportunity to recall that among the Western Allies, it was George Bush who, along with Helmut Kohl, was the main proponent of German unity and offered us a partnership in leadership at the time.   All of that is our past, which is also part of our present.   But we also see that the transatlantic partnership does not enjoy the same level of acceptance among the young generation as it does among older people.   We see that the security-policy priorities have changed  -  and with good reason  -  from the US point of view in particular.   The Pacific region is just as challenging as the European region.   Relations shifted after the end of the Cold War.   Naturally  -  and by the way, that was also the case in the past  -  we do not always agree as regards how we see and balance national and international interests.   But allow me to point out that Germany has gradually taken on more responsibility, particularly since the end of the Cold War.   Ms Amanpour just reminded us how things were when the first German troops arrived in Kosovo.   At the time, I was a junior member of the Federal Government.   We had tough discussions on whether to deploy ships to the Adriatic Sea to observe what was happening in the Western Balkans.   Today, it is completely normal for us to serve with our allies not only in the Western Balkans, but also in Afghanistan, in order to defend the United States interests and our own interests for the first time under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.   We are in Africa, in Mali.   And we know that we need to do even more.   We want to take on responsibility.   And we will do so.   This can be seen in the increasing budgets both for security expenditure and development aid.   It is our common security that we need and want to defend because we also want to protect our values.   But 80 years after the outbreak of the Second World War, the lessons from the past seem to be fading and to have lost some of their impact.   We have among us fewer and fewer eye-witnesses to the inconceivable crimes that Germans committed during the Nazi period.   There are now fewer and fewer survivors of the enormous avalanche of destruction that an inhuman ideology triggered.   That is why those of us in positions of responsibility today must remind people of the lessons of what the world experienced in the First and Second World Wars.   We must take on responsibility to ensure that peace is preserved.   We can count ourselves lucky today that we can live in peace and freedom in our countries.   But we must remember that we cannot take this for granted and constantly need to work for it.   We must remain vigilant  -  vigilant as regards social developments in and outside our countries.   We are experiencing  -  and this forms part of the analysis of our current time  -  populism and xenophobic nationalism in many countries, including here in Germany.   We see that thinking in terms of national spheres of influence is on the rise and that principles of international law or human rights are being challenged as a result.   We must take a resolute stance against this.   We should and must remember why the United Nations, the World Trade Organization and other international institutions were founded.   They were founded because of the lessons from the horrors of Nazism, the Second World War and rampant nationalism.   Working together  -  multilateralism  -  was the answer to the horrors of the first half of the twentieth century.   That continues to apply in full today, at least to my mind.   We need international rules in order to resolve conflicting interests peacefully.   That is why we need international institutions that are able to act.   Naturally, these international institutions must also be able to respond to new challenges.   They must be capable of reform and they must continue to develop, as the challenges we face as the international community also change over time.   These are challenges that I firmly believe cannot be met by countries going it alone.   These are challenges for which we all bear a duty and a responsibility.   We cannot act  -  no country can  -  as if these challenges have nothing to do with us, and I also mean Germany here, or as if they were a matter of fate and thus something we can do nothing to change.   No, globalisation, digital transformation and economic development are made by humans.   Climate change, wars and crises are also caused by humans, so we can and should do everything we can as humans to truly tackle these and other common challenges together.   That is why I want people to understand that in this world of ours, which is interconnected in so many ways, it is possible to find national common good in the global common good.   Naturally, every country has its own political priorities.   But global necessities and national interests certainly do not have to be in opposing camps.   On the contrary, I firmly believe that working on behalf of the global common good also has positive repercussions for the national common good.   In my opinion, patriotism means always considering ones own interests along with those of others.   That is why I will keep striving for the multilateral, values and rules-based world order to be strengthened.   Ladies and gentlemen, that also holds true for the European Union.   It, too, was founded because of the lessons from the horrors of the twentieth century.   One might say that Europe is also a multilateral project.   Germany will only fare well in the long term if Europe fares well.   I firmly believe that the idea of European integration is the best idea we have ever had on our continent.   Naturally, we have also had to face setbacks on the path to further developing the European Union.   I regard the decision by the people of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union as one of these setbacks.   But this decision must be respected.   That is why we will do our utmost to have good relations based on mutual trust with our neighbouring country after the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.   Theresa May has rightfully said that her country will remain part of Europe.   We want to ensure that our relations in the business sector, between our civil societies, in the security field, the foreign-policy field and many other areas are close.   Naturally, Europe can also be a drag.   I have spent enough nights dealing with that and trying to reach an outcome in negotiations.   But time and again we have proved that we are able to reach compromises.   In this way, we repeatedly find workable answers together to questions with which each individual country would be out of its depth on its own.   Ladies and gentlemen, we are currently talking again about matters that seem to be a matter of course.   The value of compromise is one of the things we are discussing.   We should hold compromises in high regard, as they are essential if people are to live together.   We could say that its too complicated for us to do something in Europe, so lets do it in Germany.   But then we would realise that the federation and Länder also need nights of talks to reach agreement.   And if we then said that we would only negotiate at the level of Federal Government, we would discover that coalition committee meetings would go on late into the night.   If we ultimately said that we dont need any compromises whatsoever, including outside the political sphere, then we only need to think about how the average family plans its weekends and imagine what would happen.   Without compromise, lunch would never get made.   Without compromise, there can be no community.   That means that if someone ultimately wants to be completely alone, they dont have to make compromises, unless they have a split personality.   But as soon as they want to live with someone, they will have to compromise.   Ladies and gentlemen, in this world of change, Europe can only be strong and able to assert its values freely and of its own accord if it is united.   And as a partner to and friend of the United States, Europe can only be as strong as it is united.   The transatlantic partnership is based on a foundation of shared values  -  on democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms.   Because that is the case, we  -  Germany, Europe and the United States  -  cannot wish for better partners.   Despite all our differences, which exist in any partnership, we should not forget that.   Now in particular, when there is a great need for discussion in transatlantic relations, we need to communicate and we need paths that lead to one another.   One way we want to forge such paths is through the Deutschlandjahr USA, which we are currently holding in the United States.   Under the motto ""Wunderbar together"", our aim is to speak with as many Americans as possible.   The over 1000 events are not just being held in large cities, but across the entire country.   Like Senator Fulbright, I firmly believe that people-to-people contacts are what make the countries of this world a true international community.   The Fulbright Program has thus proved to be a blessing, not only for generations of scholars, but also for our international relations.   That is why I can merely repeat that it is a great pleasure and honour for me to be awarded the Fulbright Prize for International Understanding.   The fact that this prize was first awarded to Nelson Mandela makes it an even greater honour.   And moreover, the fact that this award ceremony is taking place in Germany means that many of you have come a long way to be here today.   I would like to thank you for that.   And I would also like to say that perhaps Senator Fulbright is more contemporary today than he has been in quite some time.   It is good that he was with us and that we are paying tribute to him today.   Thank you very much indeed.   - - -","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel on being awarded the J.

"43","doc73451","Presidents, Esteemed colleagues, Esteemed colleagues from the parliaments, Mr Ischinger, Ladies and gentlemen, And, of course, allow me also to welcome the Minister-President of the Free State of Bavaria.   I believe that Munich is an excellent city to host this conference.   Bavarias strength is on display in a very special way here.   We have other beautiful cities in Germany, but Munich is taking centre-stage today.   Ladies and gentlemen, we are marking the 250 th anniversary of Alexander von Humboldts birth in 2019.   Alexander von Humboldt lived on the threshold of industrialisation.   He was a scholar and traveller who was driven by the urge to understand and see the world as a whole, a passion that yielded a great deal of success.   His motto, as his Mexican travel diary from the year 1803 reveals, was ""everything is interaction"".   About 200 years later, in 2000, after researching the hole in the ozone layer and its chemical interactions, Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen concluded that we were embarking upon a new geochronological age.   The Ice Age and the interglacial period are over, and we have now entered the Anthropocene.   In 2016, this definition was subsequently adopted by the International Geological Congress.   This means that we are living in an age in which humankinds traces penetrate so deeply into the Earth that future generations will regard it as an entire age created by humans.   These are traces of nuclear tests, population growth, climate change, exploitation of raw materials, and of microplastics in the oceans.   And these are but a few examples of the things that we are doing today.   All of this has implications for global security and for the issues that are being discussed right here, right now.   It therefore makes sense to take a look at how this conference started life in 1963  -  as a conference on military science, or ""Wehrkunde"" in German, still dominated by the aftermath of the Second World War and National Socialism in Germany; an event with a particularly pronounced transatlantic focus.   This is why Im also delighted that so many representatives from the US are with us here today.   We are meeting today at a comprehensive security conference, where we are discussing the energy supply, development cooperation and, of course, defence issues and a comprehensive approach to security.   This is precisely the right response.   We must think in terms of interlinked structures, of which the military component is only one.   But what we sense at the beginning of the 21 st century  -  we are now in the second decade of the 21 st century  -  is that the structures in which we operate are essentially those that emerged from the horrors of the Second World War and National Socialism, but that these structures are coming under incredible pressure because developments require them to undergo reform.   However, I dont think that we can simply take an axe to these structures.   This is why the heading of this security conference is ""The Great Puzzle"".   Allow me to start with the first part of this topic.   Rivalry between great powers  -  this alone offers us an insight into the fact that something that we regarded as a whole, as an architecture of the world, is under pressure, and is even likened to a puzzle, i.  e.   something that breaks up into pieces.   Thirty years ago  -  an anniversary that we are set to mark this year  -  the Berlin Wall fell, and with it the Iron Curtain disappeared.   The Cold War came to an end.   Back then, people asked themselves whether we still need an organisation like NATO.   Today, we know that, yes, we need NATO as an anchor of stability in turbulent times.   We need it as a community of shared values, because we should never forget that we established NATO not only as a military alliance, but also as a community of shared values in which human rights, democracy and the rule of law are the guiding principles of joint action.   The fact that NATO continues to be immensely attractive to this day became apparent to us in recent months during the wrangling over whether North Macedonia, as we can fortunately now all call this country, can also become a NATO member.   I would simply like to thank the two principal players, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev from North Macedonia and Alexis Tsipras, the Greek Prime Minister, most sincerely for their courage.   They will be presented with the Ewald von Kleist Award this evening for their efforts.   In view of the many conflicts that we face today and for which we have yet to find a solution, this is a good example of how solutions can be found if we take a courageous approach.   I had already given up thinking about further combinations of names in the meantime, because I thought it was a lost cause anyway.   Now you have met with success.   Permit me to offer you my most sincere congratulations on this achievement! There are, however, a great number conflicts that challenge us, and this is the subject of the discussions that we are holding here.   I would like to start with one issue that is a particular focus of my work, and also for many others among us, namely our relationship with Russia.   Russia, in the form of the Soviet Union, was, in a manner of speaking, the antagonist during the Cold War.   After the Berlin Wall fell, we certainly hoped  -  the NATO-Russia Founding Act came into being at that time  -  that we could make improvements to our coexistence.   When I recall now how in 2011, on the fringes of this security conference, the instruments of ratification for the New START disarmament treaty were exchanged between Hillary Clinton and Sergey Lavrov, then today, in 2019, this feels like quite a long time ago.   But back then, both Clinton and Lavrov hailed this as a milestone of the strategic partnership.   I say this to illustrate what has happened in recent years and to point out that, on the other hand, things may look completely different again in a few years from now if the different sides work with each other.   I would therefore like to thank Jens Stoltenberg most sincerely for not only invoking the NATO-Russia Founding Act time and again during the most difficult times we have had in recent years, but also for seeking dialogue.   Thank you very much indeed for this! Crimea was annexed in March 2014  -  in what was a clear violation of international law  -  and then  -  Petro Poroshenko is here today  -  came the attack on eastern Ukraine, which was followed by a painstakingly negotiated ceasefire that was fragile but kept stable by the Minsk Agreement, with which Germany and France together with Russia and Ukraine are endeavouring to resolve the conflict.   However, we must admit that we are far from achieving a solution; we must continue to work on this at all costs.   For us Europeans, if I may say so, the really bad news this year was the termination of the INF Treaty.   After not decades, but years of violations of the terms of the treaty by Russia, this termination was inevitable.   We all supported this as Europeans.   Nevertheless, this is  -  and I say this to our American colleagues  -  a most interesting constellation.   The US and Russia, as the legal successor to the Soviet Union, are terminating a treaty that was essentially agreed for Europes sake, a disarmament treaty that affects our security, and we, of course, with our elementary interests, will do everything in our power to facilitate further steps towards disarmament.   Blind rearmament cannot be our response to this.   However, since a representative from China is here today, I would say that disarmament is something that concerns us all, and we would, of course, be pleased in this regard if such negotiations were held not only between the US, Europe and Russia, but also with China.   I know that there are many reservations about this, and I dont want to go into details about this right now.   But we would welcome this.   In response to the events in Ukraine, we said in Wales in 2014 that not only the fight against terrorism, such as in Afghanistan, but also Alliance defence were once again at the forefront of our efforts.   Back then, the objective of developing the military expenditure of each country towards two percent of its respective GDP was updated once again.   I never tire of pointing out that this was already a goal at the beginning of the 2000s.   All those who wanted to become new members of NATO were told at the outset that if they did not take steps in the direction of two percent, then they would not be admitted to NATO in the first place.    -  That was before my time as Federal Chancellor.   Germany is now facing criticism in this regard.   I will address this matter later on.   We have, however, increased our defence expenditure from 1.  18 percent in 2014 to 1.  35 percent.   We aim to reach 1.  5 percent by 2024.   For many this is not enough, but for us it is an essential leap.   Of course, we must also ask ourselves what were doing with this money.   Let me put it this way: if we all fall into recession and have no economic growth, then defence spending will be easier.   But Im not so sure that this will stand to benefit the Alliance.   This is why it is important that we have such benchmarks.   However, we must also consider what tangible contribution we are making.   Germany is doing its part.   We have now been in Afghanistan for 18 years and have around 1300 German servicewomen and -men stationed there.   We are working with 20 partner countries in northern Afghanistan.   My most sincere request is that we  -  this is the first and only deployment under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which we have been engaged in together for a very long time  -  also discuss the issues of further development together.   We have had to work hard to convince our people that our security is indeed being defended on the Hindu Kush.   I really do not want to see us one day having to turn our backs on this and walk away as we have extremely interconnected capacities in the region.   We are a framework nation in Lithuania and have for the second time assumed the leadership of NATOs spearhead force.   I dont want to list everything here.   However, all of these are things that are very useful, especially as far as Alliance defence is concerned.   We are therefore also prepared to do our part.   We are now playing an active role also outside NATO, for instance in Mali.   For Germany, this is a giant step and one to which we are, culturally speaking, not as accustomed as our French friends.   It was no coincidence that a discussion took place this morning between the President of the European Union during the rotating Presidency of the Council and the new President of the African Union, the Egyptian President Abdul Fattah Al-Sisi  -  congratulations on your election, which was just a few days ago.   The questions surrounding development in Africa and relations with Africa will challenge us as Europeans in a different way than, for example, the US.   There will not always be NATO missions here.   I would therefore ask you not to think of our efforts to achieve a coherent European defence policy as something that is directed against NATO, but as something that makes cooperation within NATO more efficient and feasible, because we can overcome many of the inefficiencies that exist among the many member states that are in the European Union and in NATO if we also develop a common military culture and if we improve the way in which our weapons systems are organised.   Germany is set to face a mammoth task in this regard, I can tell you.   We now want to develop joint weapons systems.   The issue of arms exports naturally also played a role in connection with the Treaty of Aachen, which we signed with France.   If we in Europe do not have a common culture of arms exports, then the development of common weapons systems is, of course, at risk.   In other words, we cannot talk about a European army and a common arms policy or arms development if we are not prepared at the same time to pursue a common arms export policy.   We still have many complicated discussions on this subject ahead of us in Germany.   I dont think Im telling you anything that you dont already know here.   Ladies and gentlemen, alongside relations with Russia, the fight against terrorism is a major challenge for us, also in addition to the euro crisis, of course.   In 2014/2015, we conducted very intensive negotiations with Greece about remaining in the eurozone.   We then had to grapple with the refugee issue on a massive scale.   The refugee issue has been fuelled by the situation in Syria, a civil war that has also been beset with terrorist challenges.   The security issues that we faced were therefore of a very different nature compared with the ones that we face, for example, in the context of Alliance defence.   Europe was forced to ask itself whether or not we are prepared to assume responsibility in an all-consuming humanitarian drama.   That so many refugees came to Europe had to do with the fact that we had not previously addressed the situation of the refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, where three million or more had already arrived.   The stability of these countries was genuinely at risk.   The upshot was refugees placing their trust in smugglers and traffickers and deciding to take their fate into their own hands.   Against this backdrop, Europe then embraced on a task  -  not just Germany, incidentally, but also Sweden, Austria and other countries: we provided assistance in a humanitarian emergency.   But I think we all agree that states response to humanitarian emergencies cannot be for human traffickers and people smugglers to take control and for the refugees to be exposed to countless dangers, but that the right response was to create the EU-Turkey agreement.   For Germany, it was the right response to then also increase its expenditure on development assistance.   During the same period  -  during the time when the Wales decisions to move towards two percent within NATO were adopted  -  we increased our development assistance expenditure to the same degree, because we are convinced that this, too, is a security issue.   If we do not finally undertake sufficient payments for humanitarian assistance, for the Welthungerhilfe and for the UNHCR  -  and we are already one of the largest international donors  -  so that peoples livelihoods can be improved with their help, the refugee crisis will continue.   The willingness of the German people, for example, to help, was outstanding, but we nonetheless need to solve the problems on the ground.   That is what we are in the process of learning.   So that was a parallel challenge that I consider as important from a security policy perspective as boosting our ability to honour our commitments within the Alliance.   Developments in Libya  -  also with regard to Europe or in this case Italy  -  have given us a foretaste of an issue that is becoming increasingly relevant: What direction will developments on the African continent take? In Libya, the instability of the state has resulted in this Libya becoming the starting point as it were for many African refugee flows, although our Spanish friends faced these challenges in connection with Morocco much earlier, ten or 15 years previously.   That prompted the European Union to be much more consistent and resolute in developing the Partnership for Africa.   But lets be honest: we are still in the early stages of this partnership.   For if development in sub-Saharan Africa, but also in Egypt, in Morocco, in Tunisia and in Algeria does not progress in a way that gives young people opportunities and hope, that gives them prospects for a life in these countries, we will not be able to tackle the prosperity gap between Europe and Africa.   We can see that in recent years China has pursued development policy in Africa on a large scale in the form of investment.   We can see that we in Europe have implemented traditional development policy to a considerable extent.   I have often talked with President Xi Jinping about how we can learn from one another with regard to what each of us does well.   But we have not yet drawn up a development policy agenda with which we could say that investment will ultimately create enough jobs to ensure security, peace and stability in these countries, too.   Again Germany has said the following, which in the early days of the Federal Republic of Germany was not an essential part of our historical understanding: Okay, we will support the G-5 Sahel troops, which are striving to fight terrorism.   We are engaged in Mali and are working to tackle terrorism there in cooperation with the United Nations.   We are on the ground in Mali working to train the armed forces.   But all that will be in vain if these countries dont have any economic prospects.   And that is why we have increased our development assistance.   But I want to reiterate that the methodology behind this development assistance has so far not been worked out in detail; that is something we can only do together with the African Union.   I am very pleased that the African Union now has clear strategic ideas  -  the Agenda 2063 and other plans  -  in which Africa is stating what it wants.   For we need what these days is described as ""ownership"" in what has almost been adopted as a German word.   People in Africa need to feel themselves: ""These are our programmes.  "" If multilateral cooperation has improved in recent years, I have to say that in my view the African Union is certainly a good example of it.   So, ladies and gentlemen, those are the problems I wanted to outline for you and on which Germany is working.   Now I want to turn to the question of the methodology of our cooperation.   For the transatlantic alliance is, of course, in essence a defence alliance.   The Foreign Ministers meet very frequently, but for many years we have discussed with France whether it is permissible also to discuss political issues.   My theory is that NATO will only do justice to its responsibilities if it keeps its focus on the concept of networked security.   I think that is happening to some extent.   For none of these numerous conflicts can be resolved by military means alone.   Tensions, of course, run high in connection with what the answers should look like.   What are the answers with regard to Ukraine? As far as the Minsk agreements are concerned, we are united.   My heartfelt request is that implementation of sanctions against Russia be properly coordinated again if the situation escalates further  -  soldiers are now in the Kerch Strait.   We wont achieve anything if everyone implements their own sanctions.   The third point is that we continue to support the NATO-Russia Founding Act.   Communication channels need to remain open.   Then there is a fourth point: economic cooperation.   There is already a wide range of discussions taking place on this issue  -  take the example of Nord Stream 2.   I can understand Petro Poroshenko, who is sitting here and saying: Ukraine is a transit country for Russian natural gas, and wishes to remain so.   I have assured him time and again that we will give him every possible support and conduct negotiations on this issue, and we will continue to do that, the election campaign notwithstanding.   A Russian gas molecule is a Russian gas molecule, whether it comes via Ukraine or via the Baltic Sea.   That means that the question of how dependent we are on Russian gas cannot be resolved by asking which pipeline it flows through.   There, too, I say: I am ready.   Nobody wants to become totally and unilaterally dependent on Russia.   But if we even imported Russian gas during the Cold War  -  I was still in the GDR then and we consumed Russian gas there anyway, but the former Federal Republic then started importing large amounts of Russian gas  -  then I dont know why the situation today should be so much worse that we cant say that Russia remains a partner.   Let me ask you  -  again, it isnt easy to say this in the presence of President Poroshenko on the left from where Im standing and the Chinese representative on the right: Do we want to make Russia dependent on China or rely on China to import its natural gas? Is that in our European interests? No, I dont think so, either.   We also want to be involved in trade relations.   That, too, is something we need to discuss frankly.   Although there is already very high LNG capacity in Europe  -  basically we have many more LNG terminals than we have LNG gas  -  we have made the strategic decision to continue to invest in LNG in Germany, too, in view of the predicted increase in gas consumption and LNG production particularly also in the United States of America.   As we are phasing out nuclear energy as well as lignite and black coal, Germany will be a very safe market as far as natural gas is concerned, regardless of who is selling it.   Then we have the issue of Iran, which is currently a source of contention.   We need to be very careful with regard to this division, which concerns me greatly.   In a speech to the Knesset, I expressed my assurance that Israels right to exist is a fundamental guiding principle of Germany.   And I mean exactly what I said.   I am observing the ballistic missile programme, I am observing Iran in Yemen and above all I am observing Iran in Syria.   The only question that divides us, the United States and the Europeans, on this issue, is: Does it serve our common cause, our common goal of reducing the harmful and difficult influence of Iran by terminating the only agreement still in force, or would we help our cause more by keeping hold of the small anchor we have in order to perhaps be able to exert pressure in other areas? That is the tactical issue over which we do not see eye to eye.   But our goals are, of course, the same.   But Ill also ask, as I am on the receiving end of criticism every day myself: Is it good for the Americans to want to pull out of Syria immediately and quickly, or is that not also a way to strengthen the opportunities for Iran and Russia to gain influence there? We need to talk about that, too.   Those are issues that are on the table and that we need to discuss.   There is, of course, also the question of how economic relations between China, the United States and Europe should develop.   That is a huge problem.   We are observing that China is an up and coming country.   When I visit China, its representatives say: for 1700 of the two thousand years A.  D.  , we were the leading economy.   Dont get upset, all thats going to happen is that we will return to the place where we always were.   Its just that you havent experienced it in the past 300 years.   And we say: in the past 300 years we were the leaders, first the Europeans, then the United States, and then all of us together.   Now, however, we need to deal with the situation as it is and find sensible solutions so that it doesnt descend into a struggle that weakens all sides.   In this context I want to say quite clearly that I support all efforts to promote fairness and trade.   I am talking about reciprocity.   We need to talk about that.   We need to do so in a spirit of partnership and in view of the fact that we have so many other problems to resolve in the world that it would be helpful if we could reach an understanding.   I place great hope in the negotiations that are now being conducted with the United States of America in the area of trade.   I will say quite frankly that if we are serious about the transatlantic partnership, for me as German Chancellor it is a little disturbing to say the least to read that apparently  -  I havent yet seen it in writing  -  the US Department of Commerce has said that European cars are a threat to the national security of the United States of America.   You see, we are proud of our cars, and we are entitled to be so.   These vehicles are also built in the United States.   The largest BMW factory is in South Carolina, not in Bavaria, in South Carolina.   South Carolina in turn exports to China.   If these vehicles, which are no less of a threat by being built in South Carolina than they would be by being built in Bavaria, suddenly pose a threat to US national security, then this comes as a shock to us.   In that case, I can only say that I think it would be good for us to engage in proper talks.   Whenever anyone has a grievance, we need to talk about it  -  that is how things work in the world.   And then we will be able to find solutions.   Ladies and gentlemen, all these issues that are coming at us like puzzle pieces and which are too many for me to refer to here, are ultimately the expression of a fundamental question.   Because we are noticing how great the pressure is on our traditional and, to us, familiar order, this raises the question of whether we are going to break up into a lot of individual puzzle pieces and think that each of us can best solve the problem single-handedly.   As German Chancellor, I can only respond: if so, our chances are poor.   For the United States of America has so much more economic clout and the dollar as a currency is so much stronger, that I can only say: obviously it holds the better hand.   China, with more than 1.  3 billion people, is so much larger.   We can be as hard-working, as impressive, as super as we like  -  but with a population of 80 million we wont be able to keep up if China decides that it no longer wants to maintain good relations with Germany.   Thats how it will be all over the world.   So the one big question is this: Are we going to stay with the principle of multilateralism, which was the lesson we learned from the Second World War and the National Socialism caused by Germany, even when multilateralism is not always fun, but often difficult, slow, complicated? I am firmly convinced that it is better to put ourselves in one anothers shoes, to look beyond our own interests and to see whether we can achieve win-win solutions together rather than to think we can solve everything ourselves.   That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I was so pleased yesterday evening when I was preparing my speech and read a quotation by Lindsey Graham, who declared yesterday evening: ""Multilateralism may be complicated, but its better than staying at home alone.  "" I think that is the right response to the motto of this conference ""The Great Puzzle: Who Will Pick Up the Pieces?"": Only all of us together.   Thank you very much.   - - -","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel on 16 February 2019 at the 55th Munich Security Conference",2019-02-20,"Germany","A.Merkel",4593,"en"
"44","doc73441","Director-General Tedros, Ralph Brinkhaus, Hermann Gröhe, Georg Nüßlein, Fellow members of the German Bundestag, Honoured guests, Excellencies  -  I have been told by Hermann Gröhe that several Ambassadors are here today; we are pleased to have you with us.   When I say we, it is because I am a member of this parliamentary group, in addition to being Federal Chancellor.   The place I am standing today is where we normally sit side by side and listen to the debates of the day.   Its not always easy  -  but always enjoyable.   I of course also extend a warm welcome to the Federal Minister of Health.   Ladies and gentlemen, ""Those who do not find time every day for health must sacrifice a lot of time one day for illness.  "" These words of wisdom by Sebastian Kneipp are still relevant today and should be heeded not only by career politicians.   Eat healthy, get enough exercise, dont smoke, have regular medical check-ups and get vaccinated  -  and here I am referring to a current public debate in Germany that the Federal Minister of Health is strongly, and I must say rightly, engaged in  -  all this is key to avoiding the diseases of modern society.   We know there is a very close link between living a healthy lifestyle and individual well-being.   Sebastian Kneipps helpful advice makes the case for prevention  - which should have a permanent and prominent place not only in our individual lives, but also throughout the healthcare sector.   Prevention and prudent behaviour by no means apply only to individuals.   Rather, diseases always also have an impact on society as a whole.   Dealing with them requires time and money, as well as expertise and medical equipment.   It would be an overwhelming task for an individual to provide full personal health insurance.   Thats as true for each of us as it is for entire countries and regions  -  especially those that are not the most affluent in the world.   If you think that developing a healthcare system is a task that stops once you've reached a certain development threshold, then think again.   We see this every day.   If you have visited the poorest countries in the world  -  and I recently spent three days in Mali, Burkina Faso and the Niger  -  then you will have seen the range of issues for which Director-General of the World Health Organization Tedros is responsible, and how different problems are there compared to our industrialised countries.   We must of course make sure that we live healthy lifestyles and maintain good healthcare systems.   However, we also must contribute what we learn through research and development.   For example, we don't want to promote antimicrobial resistance through bad livestock farming practices that could have a global impact, and we want our development cooperation efforts help other regions attain sustainable development and health goals.   Another cabinet colleague of mine, Gerd Müller, will rightfully be participating in this congress.   So health is a shared task, in both a national and global sense.   This is especially true and evident for communicable diseases.   These can cross borders and have devastating effects.   The Ebola outbreak in 2014 in West Africa was a particularly painful reminder of this.   Currently, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we see how political instability and insecurity due to Ebola are forming a disastrous combination.   The disease is being used to assert political interests.   Aid workers are being threatened and attacked.   In April, such an attack resulted in the death of Richard Mouzoko, an epidemiologist who was on WHO deployment.   So it is true that people are sacrificing their lives, or being forced to sacrifice their lives, because in addition to horrible diseases they are caught in the crossfire of political tensions.   Mr Tedros, I also want to take this occasion to express our sincere condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Richard Mouzoko.   It is unacceptable  -  and we must stand up for the cause  -  that people who simply want to help others must risk life and limb to do so.   After all, the only thing stopping the further spread of Ebola are the committed and tireless efforts of aid workers.   Unfortunately, the number of infections recently rose again.   That is why I want to use this opportunity to repeat my appeal to all those in positions of responsibility in the region that they give aid workers truly unhindered access, so that current infection numbers dont grow into an even greater epidemic.   I know this is much easier said than done  -  especially in a region where violent outbreaks are a regular occurrence.   However, this also underscores the importance of the MONUSCO mission of the United Nations, which aims to stabilise the Democratic Republic of the Congo.   Of course, the best way to help aid workers would be to have far less need for their assistance  -  that is, if there were more prevention.   Merely reacting to health risks is not optimal  -  especially when aid efforts are obstructed by security risks, often exactly at the time when help is most urgently needed.   This is why we must continue to work together to strengthen the healthcare sector  -  also at times when health risks do not dominate the worlds headlines.   We must prepare international systems as best we can to deal with future emergencies.   Here, I want to say that significant progress has been achieved on coordinating the processes within the WHO and the UN.   I want to thank Director-General Tedros for his reform efforts, as well as for building a clearly structured system to deal with emergencies.   Mr Tedros  -  this is an area in which we would like to continue providing support.   People who are acquainted with this topic will know that, although the words of the Director-General of a UN organisation do hold sway, at the UN itself the regions often act independently.   Many good arguments and lots of persuasion are therefore needed to achieve seamless cooperation.   Of course, international agreements do not relieve individual countries of their responsibility.   Strengthening national healthcare systems is, after all, in the vested interest, and incidentally also in the economic interest, of every country  -  because health is a key prerequisite for national economic development.   Here, however, I would like to add the following: My visit to Mali, the Niger and Burkina Faso made clear to me how large the threat of terrorism is in all three countries.   They spend between 20 and 30 percent of their budgets exclusively on security.   When that happens, other equally important areas of development are short-changed.   These tasks are therefore very much interlinked  -  guaranteeing security and providing healthcare services, thereby helping to promote economic prosperity.   Germany makes available more than one billion euros annually in economic cooperation funding for health-related projects.   Our aim in doing so is to jointly work on finding solutions where they are needed.   In this connection, let me say that I very much approve of the WHO approach to not dictate solutions, but rather to travel to the respective regions first to learn what is actually required and what actions will have a lasting effect.   Because, for example, it would not make sense to build entire hospital sites at an arbitrary location without also making sure that the respective infrastructure and links are also ensured.   That is why cooperation through partnerships is urgently needed to create both acceptance in these regions and to achieve lasting, desired results.   Whether the goals be humanitarian objectives, development policy aims, economic interests or even self-motivation  -  we must act to limit the spread of diseases.   For everyone in the international community, this is a shared responsibility.   We have a duty to support poorer countries, so that they can live up to their responsibilities.   This shared responsibility is also reflected in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.   In Germany, we are committed to the Sustainable Development Goals.   That, after all, is whats special about the SDGs: rather than targeting the less developed countries, they are part of a joint, global agenda.   We have considerably stepped up our engagement on SDG 3  -  not only financially.   Hermann Gröhe has just said that we very deliberately placed this issue on our G7 and G20 presidency agendas, and weve done everything we can to make sure that it is not forgotten.   Im therefore most grateful to Japan, which holds the current G20 presidency, for focusing on the issue of Universal Health Coverage.   We want to talk about how we can obtain agreement on substantial steps towards Universal Health Coverage.   The heads of state and government will also talk about this at the United Nations in September.   This will send a very important signal, because we will thereby be highlighting the importance of global and universal health coverage.   Health issues are one of the areas where international cooperation can show what it's capable of.   An example that occurs to me is the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility of the WHO and the World Bank.   They are very valuable instruments to make crisis management funds available swiftly and without red tape.   In fact, we simulated our health emergency coordination capabilities with an exercise during our G20 presidency.   The German Government is very active in this regard.   In my opinion, it is just as important for research progress to also benefit countries with weaker economies.   Thanks to the CEPI alliance  -  the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations  -  we can more effectively deploy new vaccines, and with the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership we can efficiently and fairly distribute new antibiotics.   I would like to say the following about antibiotics: possibly one of the most serious problems  -  although it is often underestimated  -  is that we often prescribe antibiotics too liberally.   It is incredibly difficult and by no means certain that we can constantly develop new antibiotics.   This is why we must act very prudently and carefully.   Research often does not devote enough attention to many diseases in poorer countries and the ways that they can be treated  -  because of the bottom line.   There is a significant danger that rich countries will work on addressing their diseases and at the same time overlook the fact that, in other places, there are widespread diseases for which real treatment progress could be achieved with modest investments in research.   It is a matter of particular importance to me that we not forget such poverty-related diseases.   According to estimates, these affect more than one billion people.   So-called neglected tropical diseases are therefore by no means be negligible.   This is of course true for the big three  -  HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.   In Africa alone, some 250,000 children still die from malaria every year.   Knowing what a malaria net costs, and giving some thought to the idea of supplying these, it becomes obvious that we really should take action wherever we can.   To combat these diseases, we have the Global Fund, which is due to be replenished for the years 2020 to 2022 this October in Lyon.   Germany will again make a substantial contribution.   Much hope is being placed in the new malaria vaccine.   It is being tested in Malawi, took three decades to develop, and has the potential to prevent 40 percent of overall cases and 30 percent of severe cases of malaria.   It would be significant progress if we could actually get this vaccine out to where it is needed.   I think the examples Ive given prove that health alone is worth all the effort that we can devote to it.   But there are good reasons that one of the Sustainable Development Goals for the 2030 Agenda is ""health and well-being"".   This shows that health is intricately interconnected with other SDGs that affect the well-being of each and every one of us.   Considering the key role of health for a dignified life, I have joined Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo in calling for a plan of action to implement SDG 3.   Im very grateful for the committed efforts of the WHO in this regard.   Mr Tedros, this work is very important, and we will continue to support it.   Because if we know what specific measures can help accelerate progress towards, or just help achieve, health-related goals, then we can take more targeted action.   That, after all, is key to delivering on all goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.   Just think: There is a large number of recipient countries  -  there are more than 50 countries in Africa alone.   And there are certainly 60 or 70 countries that are able to provide aid for development measures.   Yet no one looks at the combined effect  -  that is, how efficiently goals in the respective country are being met.   It is therefore paramount  -  and the WHO indeed does this  -  to internationally coordinate action.   We must pay attention to what assistance is given where, and to how we can make sure that we are on the right track to achieving the SDGs.   At the World Health Summit last October here in Berlin, a first version of the plan of action was presented.   Work on drafting the final version is under way.   That will certainly also be one of the topics of discussion here today.   Initial results show that the signatory organisations  -  such as the WHO, UNICEF, the World Bank, the Global Fund and the Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance  -  are comparing and deconflicting their programmes of work and unifying their strategies.   I am very much looking forward to the final document, which is due to be presented during UN Week in September.   Maybe Mr Tedros will give us some examples of these efforts.   Of course, we also make a point of working with foundations.   The Gates Foundation, for example, is represented here today, and representatives of other foundations may be here as well.   Here, too, we must make sure that activities to reach our goals are coordinated.   I certainly hope  -  and here I turn to the head of my parliamentary group  -  that the German Bundestag will be of assistance in this regard, dear colleagues and Mr Ralph Brinkhaus.   Because I would welcome it if our parliaments could help lobby support for the action plan.   That is very important.   The fact that a subcommittee on global health was newly established this legislative term is also a sign that we believe the time has come to again focus on this issue.   I am pleased that there is broad consensus on this topic.   That of course is also very important for us in the German Government.   We know that our budget will be slightly lower this year, maybe also next year.   However, we hope that the issue of global health will remain a top priority.   I assure you that the German Government will remain strongly engaged on this issue.   We are working on a new strategy that we intend to present before the end of the year.   Finally, I would like to say that every person on earth should be able to live a healthy life.   Also in poorer countries, people must be given access to a functioning healthcare system.   With the 2030 Agenda, we made a strong commitment.   We are, however, bound not only by the document, but above all by the human imperative.   We can accomplish great things by acting as one.   I am convinced that todays congress is helping to raise the profile of this issue, and that through coordinated joint action we can make even better progress towards the ambitious goals that we have set.   Mr Gröhe, Mr Nüßlein  -  thank you for organising this congress.   I believe it is very important and I was pleased to be your guest.   Thank you very much.   - - -","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkelat the congress organised by the CDU/CSU parliamentary groupon Strengthening Global Health – Implementing United Nations SDG 3held in Berlin on 8 May 2019",2019-05-08,"Germany","A.Merkel",2599,"en"
"45","doc73431","Environment Minister Schmidt Zaldívar, Svenja Schulze, Ladies and Gentlemen, participants in the Petersberg Climate Dialogue  -  which if you count the way they do in the Ruhr District has long been a tradition; but even in Berlin something will become a tradition on the tenth outing, I would like to extend a warm welcome to you all to this event here in Berlin.   I am delighted that Chile and Germany are organising this years Petersberg Climate Dialogue together.   Please convey my very best wishes to President Piñera.   We have learnt that Chile has big ambitions.   I am very happy about that.   Our countries may be a long way apart geographically, but it is clear that they share a common desire.   So I am pleased that our cooperation here has gone so well.   The next conference will take place in about six months time.   It is a good tradition that the Petersberg Dialogue tries, in between the conferences, to work with many key stakeholders to plan the course for the future and get things moving.   Compared to previous years, something has changed.   Not just the fact that the issue itself has taken on more importance.   Around the world, children and young people are skipping school on Fridays to demonstrate for climate protection, putting the pressure on politicians worldwide.   To be honest, its anything but a comfortable feeling.   But let me say this quite clearly: what they are doing is completely understandable.   Because from young peoples perspective, our natural world and our coexistence are at stake.   They believe they need to warn against this disaster and pile the pressure on the relevant actors.   We should respond and take action.   The 2015 Paris climate agreement contained a pledge that we would effectively address climate change and reduce its impacts.   To achieve this goal, both global action and national contributions are needed.   Every country is called upon to pursue its own path.   But we also have to recognise global connections and to ensure that the world as a whole makes progress.   It is absolutely clear  -  and this is something that has been said repeatedly since the start of the climate debate  -  that we have a shared responsibility, though we are starting from very different positions.   In other words, we need to take the differing situations in various parts of the world into account when we are shaping global climate policy.   On the one hand, the goal is to reduce emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.   On the other, it is also a matter of building resilience so as to cope with the impact of climate change.   The aim is to spread the cost of climate damage as widely as possible.   Insurance solutions have become an established instrument to this end and can be further developed.   During our presidencies of the G7 in 2015 and G20 in 2017, we set up and developed the Global Partnership for Climate and Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance Solutions.   It is intended in this way to insure an additional 400 million people against climate risks by 2020.   In industrialised countries we are familiar with such insurance solutions: they are common practice.   But they are not yet so widespread in economically weaker countries.   However, it is those very countries that are particularly hard hit by climate change impacts.   So we want to work in and with the Global Commission on Adaptation to increase the political importance attached to climate change adaptation.   For instance, if we want to pursue the SDGs and tackle poverty and hunger, we cannot sit back and relax, even if this is an area where we have in fact made some progress: we must not lose sight of the dangers.   Climate related natural disasters can and will increase hunger and hardship again if we do not take action.   Agriculture will suffer.   More and more people will leave rural areas.   And there will be greater susceptibility to political instability and terrorism.   We must counter this.   On a visit to three West African countries a few days ago, I again saw for myself how difficult the situation is.   In countries such as Burkina Faso, the Niger and Mali, you can see this combination of circumstances very clearly, and the great suffering as well.   If we fail on climate protection, conflicts are virtually inevitable, given the worlds growing population and increasingly scarce resources.   This is also the reason why Germany, a non permanent member of the UN Security Council, is currently making climate and security one of its priorities.   I am very pleased that you have also discussed the issue of women here.   That is another focus of Germanys Security Council membership  -  not least in the month when we held the presidency.   I believe it is particularly important to empower and enable women as stakeholders, also in connection with security and climate protection.   Climate protection and resilience cost money, and poorer countries do not have enough.   The industrialised countries therefore pledged to provide 100 billion US dollars annually for these states from 2020.   Speaking for Germany, I can only reiterate that we stand by this goal, we stand by the sum of 100 billion US dollars, and we will double our public spending on climate financing by 2020.   Replenishing the Green Climate Fund, too, is very important for promoting low emission, climate resilient development.   This topic will be a special focus at this years Climate Change Conference in Chile.   Germany has announced that it will double its contribution to the Green Climate Fund compared to the first replenishment.   We plan to make available a total of 1.  5 billion euros.   I would be very pleased if as many countries as possible were to do the same and also substantially increase their contributions.   Looking to the countries particularly affected, I would like to say this: even if we are talking about huge sums, we need to make sure that the funding actually translates into projects.   Because lots of money goes into the pot.   But when you ask in small islands or elsewhere what has actually arrived on the ground and what has been done, then you discover that it is a very long road from pledges and the Fund to project implementation  -  even though time is of the essence.   Finally, we as the international community must ensure that global financial flows are oriented more strongly overall to sustainability and to the goals of the Paris Agreement.   So I can only welcome the formation, as the result of an initiative by Chile and Finland, of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action.   Germany has joined this Coalition.   The Helsinki Principles endorsed by the Coalition make clear what goes to make up climate friendly funding policies.   Of course, an appropriate framework is also needed, to mobilise private capital for climate protection and stimulate climate friendly investment.   Investors must and should see that it is worth investing in modern efficiency technologies rather than in facilities that gobble up resources.   For far too long, innovation and growth went hand in hand with increased raw material consumption and higher pollutant emissions.   This is something we can no longer afford, not least in view of the growing global population.   It is especially important that industrial countries use their innovative capacities even more to ensure sustainability.   In Germany you very often hear people saying that as we account only for a small proportion of CO2 emissions, its not really up to us so much.   The people who say that need to be reminded, over and over again, that we consumed unimaginable resources in the past, and so we did play a part in getting the world into such a difficult position today.   And so, bearing in mind our prosperity, we also bear a great responsibility for promoting climate friendly innovations.   This is a discussion that needs to take place in the developed industrial countries.   Germany has achieved a great deal in the development of renewables and has played something of a pioneering role.   We have had to bear relatively high costs in terms of subsidies, but these technologies are now almost market-ready.   Economies of scale have made them almost cost effective.   Today we can see that auctions, for example for the award of funding for wind energy, are resulting in wind energy being generated without additional subsidies in many places.   It is therefore also a matter of fairness for industrialised countries to develop and use climate friendly technologies.   After all, for a long time they were the main polluters and generators of emissions harmful to the climate.   It is also a matter of fairness that they recognise their responsibility to transfer technology.   In other words, we should look for ways to introduce the technology in other countries, for example within the scope of development policy, in order to get market ready products there too.   This will change our development policy in the coming years, by the way.   We will have to regard development policy more as a tool to promote the market application of innovations.   At present, commercial market mechanisms on the one hand and development policy on the other are often wholly unconnected.   Basically, we need to get to the stage where innovation transfer to ensure marketable products on the ground is a component of development policy and development cooperation.   So technological innovation plays an important role for the transition to global greenhouse gas neutrality.   Although there is much to be concerned about in this connection, there are also very many positive examples.   Allow me to mention Chile by way of example.   The country is seeing a notable boom in renewables.   For five years now, wind energy, photovoltaics and solar thermal energy have recorded high growth rates.   I find it very gratifying that German Chilean cooperation in this field is bearing fruit.   Costa Rica is another example.   It is working to transform its energy, transport and agricultural sectors with the aim of ensuring zero emissions by 2050.   China, too, is continuing to see substantial growth in renewables.   In 2018 they already accounted for more than a quarter of the countrys electricity production.   When you consider that China is a very big country with a very large population, then you realise this is something that really has an impact on a global scale and demonstrates how determined China is to face up to the challenges posed by climate change.   We see great potential for renewables in Africa.   For example, Germany is working in the Compact with Africa, an initiative launched during our G20 presidency.   The aim is to stimulate investment in Africa, to encourage African countries to make their overall fiscal policy more transparent and improve their credit standing, and also to call on German companies to invest in these countries.   We have already had some considerable success here within the scope of our bilateral reform partnerships with, for example, Ghana and Côte dIvoire.   The advances made in the transition must not be allowed to stop at the energy sector.   Thus the Indian state Sikkim has converted to a 100% organic agricultural sector.   Three further states in India are planning to do the same.   That, too, is a contribution to climate protection.   However, although I could list a lot of other good examples, we all know that this is not enough to truly attain our goals.   We are still seeing increasing warming in the northern polar regions.   Ice expanses and permafrost are at risk of disappearing, which would further increase global warming.   We know that there are tipping points in climate change which are very hard to forecast but which will have major new qualitative impacts.   And so we cannot help but worry that long periods of heat or drought have repercussions.   The FAO estimates that global grain harvests in the current 2018 2019 crop year will not be sufficient to meet demand.   So some places truly are digging into their reserves.   Storms and flooding also play a part.   And we know that this claims many lives and causes tremendous suffering.   We can see that climate change is fact.   I am therefore glad that the United Nations Secretary General has invited heads of state and government not only to the Climate Change Conference in Chile, but also to a UN Climate Change Summit in September, in order to find out what progress we have made since the adoption of the Paris Agreement.   I will be attending.   The Secretary General will put on the pressure again.   And Ms Schulze is of course right: we cannot leave the Environment Ministers on their own with the issue of climate protection.   Rather, the whole cabinet and the political leadership of each and every country must get behind it.   Let me turn now to Germany.   As agreed in Europe, we have set ourselves goals.   When it comes to the first goal for 2020  -  this has to be stated quite frankly  -  there is a gap between what we have done and what we initially thought when answering the question ""will we be able to implement that?"".   We set ourselves a very ambitious goal for 2020.   From 1990 till 2010, CO2 emissions were reduced by 20 percent  -  20 percent within 20 years, in other words.   This included all the structural change in the wake of German reunification.   Then we said we wanted to see another 20 percent fall between 2010 and 2020.   This is turning out not to be so simple.   And so we feel it is all the more incumbent on us to make it clear when it comes to the 2030 goals: these must be attained.   So, although it may not always be easy to hear, it is right and proper for the Environment Minister to insist that we put a legal framework in place for this.   We can certainly be happy that greenhouse gas emissions felt last year by 4.  5 percent compared to the previous year.   One reason for this is that we have made renewables a key pillar of our energy supply.   Well over one in three kilowatt hours used in Germany now comes from wind or solar energy, hydropower or biofuel.   However, what we are having major difficulties with is expanding the grid quickly enough so that energy from one part of Germany can be transported to those parts of the country where more electricity is needed.   This is a matter of some urgency, because we are going to phase out nuclear energy at the beginning of the 2020s, something that will again pose great challenges.   In recent months we have had one big success which will help us a great deal up to 2030 too.   We have agreed in a broad based Coal Commission to exit coal based power generation entirely by 2038.   Given the role of coal and the fact that we are phasing out nuclear power beforehand, this will be no mean feat.   The fact that agreement to exit coal by 2038 at the latest was reached across party lines, and especially between environmental associations and the German business community, is a very important milestone.   Next week in cabinet we will be deciding on the key priorities for the regions affected, because people in the coal producing districts are obviously wondering what will happen to them, and what this will mean for their future.   We will have to keep the structural pledges we make.   Because one thing is important: society needs to accept this change, and that means there needs to be a broad discussion.   So I believe we have a lot of work ahead.   We will decide on how we intend to proceed and the necessary measures before the end of the year.   We are still discussing various instruments and courses of action.   After all, there is trading in allowances in the European Union for some of the emissions, particularly in the industrial sector.   After tough negotiations, the quantity has now been readjusted so that there is a significant CO2 price for the allowances.   But we do not yet have a similar instrument for the transport, housing or agriculture sectors.   We will have to ask ourselves this: what is the right instrument? What combination of regulatory law and market economy methods is the right way to reduce CO2 emissions in agriculture, transport, construction and housing as well, so that we really do achieve our goal for 2030, a 55 percent cut? It will not be easy, in part because Germany is a transit country.   In the case of transport, everyone who fills up with petrol here in Germany counts.   They might be German car owners and lorry drivers, or they might come from Poland, France or one of our other neighbouring countries.   We must see that we have lots of European measures too.   And we do.   Europe has a very detailed plan regarding the budgets for the period from 2020 to 2030, which are available to all member states.   So we can and we must basically proceed on a year by year basis, achieving our goals each step of the way.   And we have to make sure that they really are actually implemented.   Otherwise it will get very expensive.   Otherwise we will have to spend a lot of money on allowances.   We will be able to invest the money more usefully if we achieve our targets.   Now there is a new discussion following on from what was said in Paris, namely that ""a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases"" is to be achieved ""in the second half of this century"".   Now there is a debate about how to define ""the second half of this century"".   Unarguably, it begins in 2050.   And so nine European countries led by France have said they want to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.   We are now discussing this in Germany too.   And I would like to take this opportunity to state very clearly that it is a question of climate neutrality.   In other words, it is not a matter of ensuring that there are absolutely no CO2 emissions any more, but of finding alternative mechanisms to compensate for remaining CO2 emissions.   One possibility might be reforestation  -  only possible to a limited extent in developed countries; another is CO2 storage.   CO2 storage is very controversial in Germany.   Many people are worried by it.   Other countries are considering the possibility.   As I have just said to the Environment Minister, I propose that we discuss how to achieve the goal of being climate neutral by 2050 in our climate cabinet.   The debate should not be about whether we can achieve this goal, but how.   If we find a sensible answer to this question, then we can join the initiative launched by the nine EU member states.   I hope we can.   But I also hope that we dont just simply say yes, but that we underpin our commitment and pursue it on a sound basis.   Our climate cabinet is the proper forum for this discussion.   Ladies and gentlemen, as you see, we in the Federal Government have plenty to do.   Theres the exit from coal, the 2030 goals, and we are looking ahead to 2050.   We do not know precisely what technology will enable us to do in 10 or 20 years time.   After 2030 there may possibly be things we can know nothing about just now.   But it is my belief that if we do not set ourselves ambitious targets then we will have a hard time in finding our way there.   That is why it is right to fix targets over long periods of time.   And that is why we will be wrangling very intensively with each other.   The question, ladies and gentlemen, is not ""what will it cost us to achieve these goals?"" but rather ""how much more would it cost us if we did nothing?"".   Unfortunately, not everyone in the world is convinced that this is the correct question.   I am.   That is why I believe it right to take the long view, because then the cost of adapting is lower than if you have to take ad hoc decisions.   That is our guiding principle.   I am very glad that Chile is on our side and that all of you here are playing your part, in many different ways, to ensure that we can indeed implement the Paris Agreement.   The Berlin conference at which we prepared the Kyoto Protocol was an early milestone in my political career.   We had to see then that the obligatory goals, binding in international law, were not actually where we made real progress.   After Copenhagen, though, with the adoption of the Paris Agreement, we found a way which makes it possible for far more countries to cut their CO2 emissions.   These are not obligations binding under international law, but ultimately it is a matter of achieving something binding for the entire world.   This appeal goes out to everyones sense of responsibility.   Germany intends to make its contribution.   Germany will make its contribution.   I am pleased that we are by no means alone in the world on this.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the Xth Petersberg Climate Dialogue, Berlin, 14 May 2019",2019-05-17,"Germany","A.Merkel",3472,"en"
"46","doc73421","President Bacow Fellows of the Corporation Members of the Board of Overseers Members of the Alumni Board Members of the Faculty Proud Parents and Graduates! Today is a day of joy.   Its your day.   Many congratulations! Im delighted to be here today and would like to tell you about some of my own experiences.   This ceremony marks the end of an intensive and probably also hard chapter in your lives.   Now the door to a new life is opening.   Thats exciting and inspiring.   The German writer Hermann Hesse had some wonderful words for such a situation in life.   Id like to quote him and continue in my native language: Hermann Hesse wrote: ""In all beginnings dwells a magic force for guarding us and helping us to live.  "" These words by Hermann Hesse inspired me when I completed my physics degree at the age of 24.   That was back in 1978.   The world was divided into East and West and it was in the grips of the Cold War.   I grew up in East Germany, in the GDR, the part of my country which was not free at that time, in a dictatorship.   People were oppressed and under state surveillance.   Political dissidents were persecuted.   The GDR Government was afraid that the people would flee to freedom.   Thats why it built the Berlin Wall.   It was made of concrete and steel.   Anyone caught trying to overcome it was arrested or shot dead.   This Wall which bisected Berlin divided a people, and it divided families.   My family was also divided.   My first job after college was as a physicist at the Academy of Sciences in East Berlin.   I lived near the Berlin Wall.   I walked towards it every day on my way home from my institute.   Behind it lay West Berlin, freedom.   And every day when I was very close to the Wall I had to turn away at the last minute  -  in order to head towards my apartment.   Every day I had to turn away just before reaching freedom.   I dont know how often I thought that I couldnt take it any more.   It was really frustrating.   I was not a dissident.   I didnt run up and bang against the Wall.   Nor, however, did I deny its existence, for I didnt want to lie to myself.   The Berlin Wall limited my opportunities.   It quite literally stood in my way.   However, there was one thing which this Wall couldnt do during all of those years: it couldnt impose limits on my inner thoughts.   My personality, my imagination, my dreams and desires  -  prohibitions or coercion couldnt limit any of that.   Then came 1989.   A common desire for freedom unleashed incredible forces throughout Europe.   In Poland, in Hungary, in Czechoslovakia, as well as in the GDR, hundreds of thousands of people dared to take to the streets.   People demonstrated and brought down the Wall.   Something which many people  -  including myself  -  would not have believed possible became reality.   Where there was once only a dark wall, a door suddenly opened.   For me, too, the moment had come to walk through that door.   I no longer had to turn away from freedom at the last minute.   I was able to cross this border and venture out into the wide world.   During these months 30 years ago, I experienced first-hand that nothing has to stay the way it is.   This experience is the first thought I want to share with you today for your future: Anything that seems to be set in stone or inalterable can indeed change.   In matters both large and small, it holds true that every change begins in the mind.   My parents generation discovered this is in a most painful way.   My father and mother were born in 1926 and 1928.   When they were as old as most of you here today, the betrayal of all civilized values that was the Shoah and World War II had just ended.   My country  -  Germany  -  had brought unimaginable suffering on Europe and the world.   The victors and the defeated could easily have remained irreconcilable for many years.   But instead, Europe overcame centuries-old conflicts.   A peaceful order based on common values rather than supposed national strength emerged.   Despite all the discussions and temporary setbacks, I firmly believe that we Europeans have united for the better.   The relationship between Germans and Americans also demonstrates how erstwhile wartime enemies can became friends.   The transatlantic partnership  -  based on values such as democracy and human rights  -  has given us an era of peace and prosperity of benefit to all sides which has lasted for more than 70 years now.   And today? It will not be long now before the politicians of my generation are no longer the subject of the ""Exercising Leadership"" program and, at most, will be dealt with in ""Leadership in History"".   Harvard Class of 2019, your generation will be faced with the challenges of the 21st century in the coming decades.   You are among those who will lead us into the future.   Protectionism and trade conflicts jeopardize free international trade and thus the foundation of our prosperity.   The digital transformation affects all facets of our lives.   Wars and terrorism lead to forced migration.   Climate change poses a threat to our planets natural resources.   It and the resulting crises are caused by humans.   Therefore, we can and must do everything we possibly can to truly master this challenge to humankind.   Its still possible.   However, each and every one of us must play our part and  -  I say this with a measure of self-criticism  -  get better.   I will therefore do everything in my power to ensure that Germany  -  my country  -  achieves climate neutrality by 2050.   Changes for the better are possible if we tackle them together.   Individual countries cannot achieve much on their own.   The second thought I want to share with you is therefore: More than ever, our way of thinking and our actions have to be multilateral rather than unilateral, global rather than national, outward-looking rather than isolationist.   In short: we have to work together rather than alone.   You as graduates will have quite different opportunities to do this in future than my generation did.   Your smartphone probably has considerably more processing power than the copy of an IBM mainframe computer manufactured in the Soviet Union which I was allowed to use for my dissertation in the GDR in 1986.   Today we use artificial intelligence, for example, to search through millions of images for symptoms of disease in order, among other things, to better diagnose cancer.   In future, empathetic robots could help doctors and nurses to focus on the individual needs of patients.   We cannot predict today which applications will be possible.   However, the opportunities it brings are truly breathtaking.   How we use these opportunities will be largely up to you as graduates.   You are the ones who will be involved in deciding how our approach to how we work, communicate, get about  -  indeed our entire way of life  -  will develop.   As Federal Chancellor I often have to ask myself: Am I doing the right thing? Am I doing something because it is right or simply because it is possible? That is something you need to keep asking yourselves, too, and that is the third insight I have for you today.   Are we laying down the rules for technology, or is technology dictating how we interact? Do we prioritize people as individuals with their human dignity and all their many facets, or do we see in them merely consumers, data sources, objects of surveillance? These are difficult questions.   I have learned that we can find good answers even to difficult questions if we always try to view the world through the eyes of others.   If we respect other peoples history, traditions, religion and identity.   If we hold fast to our inalienable values and act in accordance with them.   And if we dont always act on our first impulses, even when there is pressure to make a snap decision, but instead take a moment to stop, be still, think, pause.   Granted, that certainly takes courage.   Above all, it calls for truthfulness in our attitude towards others and  -  perhaps most importantly  -  it calls for us to be honest with ourselves.   What better place to begin to do so than here in this place where so many young people from all over the world come to learn, research and discuss the issues of our time under the maxim of truth? That requires us not to describe lies as truth or truth as lies.   It requires us not to accept shortcomings as our normality.   Yet what could stop you, what could stop us from doing that? Once again, the answer is walls.   Walls in peoples minds: walls of ignorance and narrow-mindedness.   They exist between family members as well as between societal groups, people of different skin colors, nations and religions.   I would like to see us break down these walls.   Walls that keep preventing us from envisioning the world in which, together, we want to live.   Whether we manage to do that is up to us.   Thats why my fourth thought for you graduates to consider is this: Nothing can be taken for granted.   Our individual liberties are not givens.   Democracy is not something we can take for granted, neither is peace, neither is prosperity.   But if we break down the walls that hem us in, if we step out into the open and have the courage to embrace new beginnings, everything is possible.   Walls can collapse.   Dictatorships can disappear.   We can halt global warming.   We can eradicate starvation.   We can eliminate diseases.   We can give people, especially girls, access to education.   We can fight the causes of displacement and forced migration.   We can do all of that.   So lets not start by asking what isnt possible or focusing on what has always been that way.   Lets start by asking what is possible and looking for things that have never been done like that before.   This is exactly what I said to the Bundestag, the German Parliament in 2005, in my first policy statement as newly elected Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany and the first woman to hold this office.   And I want to use precisely these words to share with you my fifth insight: Let us surprise ourselves by showing what is possible.   Let us surprise ourselves by showing what we are capable of! In my own life it was the fall of the Berlin Wall that allowed me, almost 30 years ago, to step out into the open.   At that point, I left my work as a scientist behind me and entered politics.   That was an exciting and magical time, just as your lives will be exciting and magical.   But I also experienced moments of doubt and worry.   At that time, we all knew what lay behind us but not what might lie ahead.   Perhaps that reflects a little how you, too, are feeling today, amidst all the joy of this occasion.   The sixth insight I therefore want to share with you is this: The moment when you step out into the open is also a moment of risk-taking.   Letting go of the old is part of a new beginning.   It is a universal truth that there is no beginning without an end, no day without night, no life without death.   Our whole life consists of the difference, the space between beginning and ending.   What lies in between we call life and experience.   I believe that we need to be prepared to keep bringing things to an end in order to feel the magic of new beginnings and to make the most of opportunities.   That was what I learned as a student, as a scientist, and it is what I experience now in politics.   And who knows what life will bring after my time as a politician.   That remains to be seen.   Only one thing is clear: it will be something different, and something new.   [English] Thats why I want to leave this advice with you: Tear down walls of ignorance and narrow-mindedness, for nothing has to stay as it is.   Take joint action  -  in the interests of a multilateral global world.   Keep asking yourselves: Am I doing something because it is right or simply because it is possible? Dont forget that freedom is never something that can be taken for granted.   Surprise yourselves with what is possible.   Remember that openness always involves risks.   Letting go of the old is part of a new beginning.   And above all: Nothing can be taken for granted, everything is possible.   Thank you very much.","Speech by Dr Angela Merkel, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, on the occasion of the 368th Harvard University Commencementon May 30, 2019in Cambridge, MA",2019-05-30,"Germany","A.Merkel",2113,"en"
"47","doc73411","Mr President, Excellencies, Director-General Guy Ryder, Workers and employers representatives, Ladies and gentlemen, The fairness of a society and how much it values individuals is also and particularly visible in its working conditions.   Are people viewed only as factors of production  -  or can they pursue their potential and develop their talents? Do they earn enough to lead a dignified life? What about health and safety in the workplace? It has always been the goal of the International Labour Organization to establish humane working conditions.   ILO member countries jointly endeavour to promote such conditions.   It is indeed the business sector that must serve the individual  -  not the other way around.   I think this is the key principle that we must keep reminding ourselves of  -  especially in an age of increasing globalisation.   That is why I want to thank you very much, Director-General Ryder, for inviting me to speak here today.   This is the 108 session of the International Labour Conference  -  and it is a very special one.   Because this is also the high point of the celebrations marking the centenary of the ILO.   I want to extend my special congratulations on this birthday  -  to you, to the organisation and to all those who feel committed to the ILOs mission and objectives, namely, advancing social justice and promoting decent work.   Incidentally, this is not the first centenary that I have been able to celebrate with you.   I fondly recall my visit eight years ago.   It was on the occasion of the 100 International Labour Conference.   The International Labour Organization is needed as much today as it was in its early days one hundred years ago.   At the end of the First World War, the delegates to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference discussed not only the demarcation of borders, redistribution of territories, responsibility for the war and reparations.   They also talked about the rights of workers.   Social issues were fully part of the peace process  -  and that was a very far-sighted decision.   As a result, 1919 saw the founding of not only the League of Nations, but also the International Labour Organization.   This opened a new chapter in cooperation between states.   How can we preserve peace? The ILO has a clear answer  -  through social justice.   The Preamble of the ILO Constitution states that the High Contracting Parties are ""moved by sentiments of justice and humanity as well as by the desire to secure the permanent peace of the world.  "" This desire, however, would soon prove ill fated.   In 1939, only two decades later, Germany unleashed the Second World War.   Along with Germany's betrayal of all civilised values that was the Shoa, the war brought horror, loss of life and crimes against humanity that had never been seen before.   It is therefore impossible to overstate the importance of the fact that, once the horrors ended, far-sighted women and men set about building a peaceful order in Europe.   A historic stroke of luck, great political acumen and a far-sighted strategy  -  all of these terms aptly describe the developments at the time.   Over the next decades, these developments would set in motion the process of European integration and the establishment of an international peaceful order.   First and foremost, this gave rise to the United Nations and, with it, the International Labour Organization, as a specialised UN agency.   Over the years, the number of member countries has grown steadily  -  from an initial 32 to 187 today.   With the growth in membership, the political weight of the ILO also increased.   The International Labour Organization has a unique tripartite structure.   It is a forum in which governments, employers and workers representatives have been meeting for one hundred years now to agree on joint rules for decent working conditions  -  and to monitor their observance.   Germanys social market economy is closely modelled on this shared responsibility of workers, employers and governments.   Even though not all present-day member countries have labour organisations and workers unions that feel duty-bound to assume a share of the responsibility, I do believe the mission of the International Labour Organization is very far-sighted and focused on the future.   In 1969, on the organisations 50 birthday, the ILO was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.   The Director-General at the time, David A.   Morse, remarked that ""even though, as an organisation, we can look back on a 50-year history, our task has only just begun.  "" In fact, even after one hundred years, we can say that there still is an incredible amount of work to be done  -  unfortunately.   Even today, as we mark the ILO's 100 birthday, there is no denying that the mission to promote decent working conditions remains an urgent one.   Tomorrow, 12 June, serves as yet another reminder.   It is the World Day Against Child Labour.   Since it was founded, the International Labour Organization has been combating child labour.   In its current campaign, the ILO is demanding that ""Children shouldnt work in fields, but on dreams.  "" Yet, what many children experience instead is a nightmare.   More than 152 million children around the world are forced to work.   Nearly half are only five to eleven years old.   73 million children are even performing dangerous labour.   This is a situation that we can in no way accept.   We must all join together to fight this injustice.   In our closely interconnected world, we need to get much better at turning economic growth into true social progress  -  progress from which everyone, including children, can benefit.   Many, however, feel that developments are moving in the opposite direction.   They are under the impression that, while globalisation makes many people rich, it also causes social inequality to rise.   Labour migrants in particular are often in a difficult situation in the world of work.   According to ILO estimates, there are 232 million labour migrants worldwide.   Millions have been, and continue to be, exploited  -  on construction sites, in the agricultural sector and as domestic servants.   Many are abused and live in slave-like conditions; they can do either nothing or next to nothing to protect themselves.   Some 700 million workers worldwide live in poverty and are forced to live on less than 3.  20 US dollars a day.   It is no coincidence that the eighth Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations 2030 Agenda calls for both decent work and economic growth.   Injustice and discrimination in the workplace are painful reminders of how pertinent the ILO Declaration of Philadelphia of 1944 is even today.   Among the fundamental principles it underscores are the following: ""Labour is not a commodity.   [.  .  .  ] poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere; the war against want requires to be carried on with unrelenting vigour within each nation, and by continuous and concerted international effort [.  .  .  ].  "" It is precisely this continuous and concerted effort that is demonstrated by the International Labour Organization.   It campaigns for workplace safety and against discrimination, both in personnel selection and on the job.   It promotes gender equality and thereby strengthens the role of women.   It fosters social dialogue.   It fights against forced labour and human trafficking.   It is the ILO that time and again draws attention to injustice, conducts programmes to address it around the world and monitors compliance with decent working and social standards.   Many of the problems that the ILO has been fighting and addressing for one hundred years persist to this day  -  unfortunately, and despite all of the progress.   On another note, with advance of digital technology, we are increasingly witnessing the most radical transformation of our world of work since the industrial revolution.   Companies often choose to outsource their digital work.   Many tasks are being performed on platforms, such as translation into foreign languages or the editing of image files.   Even though the development of new technologies will not reduce the importance of human work and there will be plenty of work to go around, the nature of those tasks will change time and again, and new professional qualifications will be needed.   This issue is on many peoples minds  -  also in Germany.   People are asking themselves if their skills will be enough to keep up, if their profession is future-proof, if their job will be cut  -  and, if it is, where they can find comparable follow-on work.   These are big and serious questions  -  which means they are also big and serious challenges for policy-makers.   As if this were not enough, modern technology is changing not only our labour options, but also how and where we work  -  whether it be in a company, at home or on the go.   This of course gives rise to certain expectations of workers and employers.   Remote work can help us better combine work and family life  -  just as it can increase job-related demands, because we are always available.   This means we need to completely rethink many aspects related to working conditions  -  also because the traditional relationship between employers and workers is being transformed.   How can a platform be called on to respect workers rights? How can or should human and artificial intelligence complement one another? How is the further training that people need being guaranteed? In Germany, we have drawn up a further-training strategy that is being presented today and that we will soon be adopting in the cabinet.   Many countries around the world are doing the same.   It is a good thing that the International Labour Organization takes these issues very seriously.   It has established an independent Global Commission on the Future of Work, which has been tasked with finding adequate answers to these questions.   Of course, we are also addressing these issues at the level of the European Union.   In recent months, we have repeatedly examined proposals on the social dimension of Europe, such as a legislative proposal for establishing a European Labour Authority, and a Directive on work-life balance for parents and carers.   A minimum wage is another current topic in the European Union.   Germany has a minimum wage, and so do many other member states.   Now, we need to see how we can achieve comparable minimum wages that take into account the different living standards in our countries.   At any rate, it is obvious that there must be minimum standards for work, in the European Union and elsewhere.   Because our economies are based on the division of labour and highly interdependent, we absolutely need reliable international cooperation and common rules.   That is as true for Europe as it is around the world.   I say this with regard to not only the International Labour Organization, but also the World Trade Organization.   I will also mention the G7 and G20 formats, in which Germany is strongly engaged, especially when it comes to campaigning for good working conditions.   Without a doubt, the leading industrialised nations of the world greatly benefit from globalisation and the international division of labour.   That is why these countries, the industrialised nations, have a special responsibility not only to ensure fair working conditions at home, but also to campaign for these working conditions abroad, all along the global supply and value chains.   A good example of this is the Vision Zero Fund that was adopted in 2015 during Germanys Presidency of the G7  -  a global prevention fund that aims to provide better health protection and to prevent work-related injuries.   I am very grateful that the ILO is implementing the Vision Zero Fund.   Initial projects are already under way  -  including in Myanmar, Laos, Ethiopia and Madagascar.   In each of these countries, the governments decide together with the social partners what workplace safety projects are to be promoted by the Fund.   In the G7 and the G20, we also pay special attention to how we can strengthen the status of women in business and society around the world, especially in poorer countries.   With this in mind, the G7 and G20 have decided to work to promote equal and better access for women to the labour market.   This includes further advancing the vocational qualification of women in developing countries.   However, in some industrialised countries, as well, there is much room for improvement on gender equality in the business sector.   In Germany, the share of women in supervisory boards increased to one-third only when we passed a law to that effect.   This became necessary because the various voluntary commitments in the private sector had not borne fruit.   Even today, none of the largest industrial corporations have a woman as their top executive.   This can and must not continue.   A female Chancellor will not make up for stagnation in the private sector on this issue.   Ladies and gentlemen, the ILO demonstrates every year with its International Labour Conference how much progress we can make through multilateral action  -  and the extent to which we depend on such action.   Government representatives from 187 countries, as well as employer and worker representatives, get together to develop labour standards and social norms and to monitor their application and observance.   The focus of this years International Labour Conference is on drawing up an ILO centenary declaration on the future of work.   I very much welcome this initiative.   The intention is to set guidelines for the world of work, against the background of the rapid pace of globalisation and the digital transformation, and in view of the challenges of climate change and demographic change.   I predict that, in the lead-up to the final document, there will be long, tough discussions.   But it would certainly not be the first time that the ILO is able to demonstrate that it has the power that is necessary to reach a compromise.   Ladies and gentlemen, because this international system of multilateral cooperation is currently under threat  -  due to many insisting that ""were better off on our own""  -  I want to clearly state that compromise is part and parcel of international cooperation.   Compromise itself should not be attacked.   Rather, it offers the possibility to achieve a common result that incorporates different points of view from around the world.   Compromise will hardly give an individual one hundred percent of what he or she wants.   But compromise does enable collective progress.   The ILO has delivered proof of the ability to compromise over the course of its 100-year history, and has made this its model for success.   Delegates to the past 107 International Labour Conferences have time and again managed to translate their values into conventions and recommendations.   The outcome is a comprehensive and universally applicable system of norms for a world of work that is based on justice.   In addition to 205 recommendations, they have adopted 189 conventions.   No doubt  -  as I have said before  -  much remains to be done.   But without these 189 conventions, our world would be much worse off.   They set out four fundamental principles, namely freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of forced or compulsory labour, the abolition of child labour, and the elimination of discrimination.   These fundamental principles are described in detail in eight conventions.   More than 140 ILO member countries, including Germany, have ratified all eight of these fundamental principles and rights at work.   It would be good if the remaining member countries  -  and there are more than 40 of them  -  could also bring themselves to ratify it.   Ladies and gentlemen, decent work with good working conditions that enables people to live a good life  -  I am sure that many roads will get us to this destination.   However, too many people in the world still do not have the opportunity to reach it.   Too many face insurmountable obstacles on this path.   That is why, compared to one hundred year ago, the basic situation has not changed.   We still need the committed efforts of the International Labour Organization.   I have always been a strong proponent of this organisation, like many others, getting involved in the G20 process; it ensures that they stay in direct contact.   We need social peace.   We need fair working conditions.   We need to protect human dignity.   The ILO has achieved a great deal.   I would like to sincerely congratulate it on this.   Yet, at the same time, it has its work cut out for it.   I hope your accomplishments will spur you on to keep up your efforts and enthusiastically tackle your next challenges, even though the framework for your engagement has changed.   I want to say a special word of thanks to those individuals who  -  on a daily basis and often far from the headlines of the worlds major newspapers and the internet  -  do the hard negotiating, struggling to dot the is and cross the ts: Thank you for the work that you do  -  because it benefits many people who can now hope to improve their working conditions or have the right to insist on better working conditions.   Germany will remain an active ILO member.   You have the principle of human dignity, and human rights, on your side.   And that is why you are fighting for the right cause.   I would like to say this to all governments, and to all employers and workers representatives.   I wish you all the best.   We will support you in this fight.   Thank you very much indeed.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel marking the 100th anniversary of the founding of the International Labour Organization",2019-06-11,"Germany","A.Merkel",2837,"en"
"48","doc73401","Nuncio, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be able to offer all of you a warm welcome to Schloss Meseberg.   When we met here last year, I talked about the fact that we are living through turbulent times.   Little has changed in this respect to this day  -  we need only to think of the many conflicts right now, of the abandonment of agreements in the field of arms control and non-proliferation or of the conflicts in foreign trade.   These examples also show how quickly trust, which has often been painstakingly built up over many years, can be lost again.   That is why I would like to address you personally, Excellencies, because you play a key role here.   You are ambassadors, mediators, advocates and representatives all at once.   You promote dialogue in a wide range of ways and you give the countries you hail from a face here in Germany, while at the same time painting a picture of Germany at home.   You therefore have a decisive impact on the political as well as the societal relations between our countries.   The willingness and ability to engage in constructive dialogue is an invaluable asset in itself.   I think the history of the 20 th century has made this fact abundantly clear to us.   After the end of the Second World War and the betrayal of all civilised values that was the Shoa, with which Germany, my country, had brought infinite suffering to Europe and the world, far-sighted women and men set about creating a peaceful order.   Germany was able to find a new, firm place in the international community.   Wartime adversaries became allies, partners and friends.   All of this would have been unthinkable without trust and without the foundations of democracy, freedom and the rule of law.   The fall of the Berlin Wall 30 years ago, which paved the way for German unity, would likewise never have been conceivable without the trust that was extended towards Germany, trust built up through constant dialogue.   The same is true for todays challenges.   But with dialogue and trust, everything is possible.   We need only think of the solution to the name dispute between North Macedonia and Greece, which is a recent example of how solutions can suddenly be found even in conflicts that have been deadlocked for decades.   This required persistent mediation from the UN, support from the EU and, in particular, the trust that Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who was in office until yesterday, were willing to place in each other.   Building mutual trust therefore enables progress in the respective national interest and in the European or indeed global interest.   This mindset also guides Franco-German cooperation.   In the Treaty of Aachen, which we signed in January of this year, we gave expression to our shared ideas for the further development of Europe.   In the Normandy format, Germany and France are continuing their mediation efforts to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine.   It is worth every effort to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population on the ground and to enforce international law based on the principle of the sovereign equality of states.   Moreover, for the first time in the history of the UN Security Council, there was a joint presidency held by Germany and France.   During the two months of this joint presidency, a resolution on preventing and responding to sexual violence in conflict was adopted.   The cooperation in a spirit of trust between a number of countries has also made it possible to prosecute criminals internationally more effectively from now on.   Trust and a broad willingness to cooperate are also required when it comes to, at long last, creating lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan.   Thanks to the efforts of the US and the Afghan Government, the work towards achieving a political settlement in Afghanistan is gradually beginning to take shape.   I hope that the intra-Afghan meeting on Sunday, initiated by Germany and Qatar, will inject further movement into the peace process.   There are, unfortunately, far too many examples of how long and difficult it is to build trust and peace The international community has witnessed the terrible war in Syria for eight years now.   We still firmly believe that only a political process based on UN Security Council Resolution 2254 and under the auspices of the UN can end the bloodshed in Syria, build confidence, initiate national reconciliation and allow the Syrian people  -  both in the region and including Syrians who have fled to other countries  -  to decide the political future of their country for themselves in free elections.   Together with the UN and our international partners, the Federal Government will continue to work to advance the political process.   But I regret to say that were moving at a glacial pace.   We also need urgent progress in Yemen in view of the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the region.   It is important to support the work of the UN Special Envoy for Yemen in particular The situation in the Sudan also fills us with concern and the country stands at a crossroads.   The formation of a transitional government will hopefully open the door to a peaceful path of democracy and economic development.   This is mainly thanks to the mediation efforts of the African Union and Ethiopia.   Thank you so very much for this.   We are also following the situation in Libya with great concern.   The terrible developments that go hand in hand with the ongoing conflict were recently demonstrated by the terrible attack on a camp of African refugees and migrants, which claimed many lives and injured a great number of people.   As a member of the UN Security Council, Germany chairs the Sanctions Committee on Libya.   Germany supports the UNs efforts to achieve an unconditional ceasefire and to return to a political process.   I can only say that this is urgently needed in light of the current situation.   Far too many weapons reach Libya with the help of external actors.   The arms embargo must therefore be implemented in order to prevent further escalation.   We must make every effort to ensure that there is no development of the kind that we have seen in Syria for years.   The fragile situation in Libya also has knock-on effects with respect to the security situation in the Sahel region.   In May, I visited Mali, where the Bundeswehr is participating in the UN stabilisation mission MINUSMA, as well as the Niger and Burkina Faso.   In the discussions held there, the Presidents were unanimous in their view that international terrorism can only be pushed back by joining forces.   Unfortunately, the security situation in this region is deteriorating dramatically in certain quarters at the moment.   It goes without saying that progress with respect to the security and stability of the region also depends on the G5 countries own efforts.   Nevertheless, international partners can and should lend their support in this regard.   By joining forces, it is possible to achieve greater stability and therefore improved development prospects in the Sahel region.   The preamble to the 2030 Agenda of the UN rightly points out that ""there can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development.  "" Indeed, security is a fundamental prerequisite for economic prosperity, which, in turn, helps to prevent radicalisation.   Security policy and civilian engagement are therefore two sides of the same coin.   From a European perspective, it is particularly important to support our neighbouring continent Africas ownership of its security and development.   The Federal Government is working on this issue in a variety of ways.   Africa as a whole is not only rich in natural resources, but is, first and foremost, an innovative continent because it is home to so many young people  -  a continent with great economic potential; and we must make better use of this potential.   The envisaged African Continental Free Trade Area, which was agreed at the Conference of the African Union in the Niger, may be the key to this.   However, we have also seen that economic growth is not keeping pace with population growth in a number of regions of Africa and that there continues to be too much povert At the same time, some African countries are becoming increasingly attractive economic partners for Germany and Europe.   This applies in particular to the countries of the Compact with Africa initiative, which we launched in 2017 during Germanys G20 Presidency.   The fact that foreign direct investment has risen significantly in these countries in recent years goes to show how important the Compact with Africa is.   I will therefore meet the heads of state and government of the CwA countries in Berlin once again this year.   I would like to encourage them to continue down the growth-friendly reform path that they have embarked on.   Above all, however, we want to promote economic development with very concrete investment offers.   We also want to hold earnest discussions about how we can better support each other.   German businesses should invest even more in Africa  -  and this is something that we are working on.   An investors conference will therefore be held at the same time as this conference.   This commitment is part of the overall picture of a partnership based on mutual trust  -  and on the fact that Africans themselves know best what is necessary and right for the development of their continent.   It was with this in mind that the Federal Government updated its Africa Policy Guidelines in order to strengthen our partnerships.   To this end, we are focusing on topics such as the digital transformation and innovation, education and training  -  which are absolutely fundamental  -  as well as on employment, trade and investment.   The G20 Summits likewise focus on the major issues of the future.   Their results are not always entirely convincing, however.   At the last G20 Summit in Osaka, for example, we again achieved only a 19:1 result on climate protection and only a minimum consensus on trade and migration issues.   Nevertheless, I would like to thank the Japanese Presidency most sincerely for its tireless efforts.   On the issue of artificial intelligence, common principles for the responsible development and use of this technology were adopted at any rate.   In Osaka, the G20 also reaffirmed its commitment to reforming the WTO.   The main issues here are comparable conditions of competition, greater transparency and effective dispute settlement mechanisms.   The common rules of the WTO trading system are of paramount importance for our economies, which are linked by international value chains.   After all, the decisions and economic developments of some always have an impact on the economies of others.   We feel this most keenly.   This is why a multilateral approach to trade policy is and remains the best of all pathways for the global economy as a whole.   In the spirit of rules-based, fair and free trade, Germany also supports the EU in its efforts to conclude bilateral and regional trade agreements.   An agreement was recently reached with the Mercosur states to create the worlds largest free trade area with 780 million inhabitants.   I firmly believe that companies, employees and consumers in Europe and South America will benefit from this in equal measure.   The fact that the agreement between the EU and Mercosur also contains a commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement shows that we have much more in common than just economic relations.   Ultimately, we can only master the great challenges of humanity together.   In view of all the global challenges  -  climate change, poverty, hunger, disease, access to education, the digital revolution  -  we cannot emphasise often enough the fact that the national good in our highly interconnected world always depends on the global common good.   More than ever, our way of thinking and our actions have to be multilateral rather than unilateral, outward-looking rather than isolationist, global rather than national, and together rather than alone.   There are so many good examples that show what trust between states can achieve and how important and necessary international cooperation is.   A noteworthy example of this is the Treaty on Open Skies.   Within the framework of this Treaty, 34 States Parties from Vancouver to Vladivostok share an observation aircraft that each State Party may use each year to conduct a certain number of agreed observation flights in the airspace of other States Parties.   These flights use sensors for photo, radar and infrared recording as well as digital sensors.   Germany made a new aircraft available for this purpose in June of this year.   Individuals from both the observing and observed parties are involved in the conduct of all observation flights.   The country being overflown has its own military personnel on board.   The Treaty thus not only ensures trust and cooperative security, but also makes a tangible contribution to conflict prevention and crisis management.   Ladies and gentlemen, the famous German natural scientist Alexander von Humboldt, whose 250 th birthday we are marking this year, firmly believed that everything was interaction.   He was also of the opinion that ""the most dangerous world view is the world view of those who have never viewed the world"".   You, on the other hand, who work in the diplomatic service, view the world.   You build contacts.   You explain points of view and mediate between points of view.   You help to build and consolidate the trust that is essential for good cooperation.   Im grateful that you are available to us as points of contact.   I also say this on behalf of the entire Federal Government, of which many members are here today: the Head of the Federal Chancellery, the Minister of State from the Foreign Office, the Minister of State from the Federal Chancellery, the Parliamentary State Secretary from the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and another Parliamentary State Secretary, and so on and so forth; were just trying to outdo each other here.   When the Minister is out and about, then the Parliamentary State Secretaries can also indulge in a spot of travelling, which is nice.   It goes without saying that Directors-General from the Federal Chancellery and various ministries are also here.   All of us are looking forward to continuing our work with you.   Thank you  -  and a warm welcome to you once again.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel at the reception for the Diplomatic Corps",2019-07-09,"Germany","A.Merkel",2357,"en"
"49","doc97981","Excellencies, Fellow members of the German Bundestag, Ms Eid, Mr Vrolijk, Mr Stäcker, Ladies and gentlemen, And most importantly, Julia Rotich, During Germanys G20 Presidency in 2017, one of the events I attended was the Women20 Dialogue Forum, a panel discussion in Berlin.   We talked about how more can be done to support women in social, political and economic leadership roles.   Juliana Rotich, a successful young entrepreneur, was also at this event.   I have very vivid memories of how much she inspired the audience with her beliefs and ideas.   Ms Rotich, you have demonstrated an outstanding sense of what matters in social policy, as well as entrepreneurial expertise, particularly as regards digital advances in Africa.   As a result, you are receiving the German Africa Award today, and I can only congratulate the jury on choosing you as the winner.   Allow me to take this opportunity to congratulate you in person now.   How does innovation start? It always begins with the courage to call things into question and the refusal to accept things as they are.   And many people in Africa demonstrate the courage to take risks and to try something new.   In the Horn of Africa region, for example, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed showed great courage and strength in opening up his countrys economic and political system.   He was awarded this years Nobel Peace Prize for this and for his endeavours to achieve peace with Eritrea.   Following decades of dictatorship, the people in the Sudan can now also hope for peaceful and democratic coexistence, even if there is no doubt whatsoever that the challenges are still enormous.   The progress in the path to founding an African Continental Free Trade Area is also a welcome development.   The launch of the operational phase of the free trade area in late May was a major milestone on this path.   The fact that the Niger was able to host an African Union conference for the first time was also a great milestone for the country.   I hope that the goal of a free trade area will be achieved and that intra-African trade can gain significant momentum.   Not only do these and many other new developments demonstrate courage, they also encourage people.   Ms Rotich, you are one of the people who have taken on this responsibility and role-model function.   You fight for greater political ownership and transparency.   And you do so with the help of new technologies.   With the open-source platform Ushahidi and the tech firm BRCK, which you co-founded and co-developed, you have shown how innovative IT products can improve the day-to-day lives of many, many people.   Ushahidi has been translated into more than 30 languages and is used in many countries to shed more light on current events and to create transparency, be this for the purpose of crisis response or election observation.   Civil-society engagement has thus been strengthened in a very concrete way.   BRCKs multi-connector device is sold all over the world.   Even in crisis situations, it ensures that people can communicate without any problems.   In a nutshell, Ms Rotich, it is thanks not least to you that ""IT Made in Africa"" is in demand worldwide.   Africa is a rapidly developing market for information and communications technology.   Whether we are talking about the healthcare system, the education system, the financial sector or other services, digital progress can be seen almost everywhere.   This often takes the form of huge technological leaps forward, whereby obsolete technologies are simply bypassed in favour of the latest tech developments.   I also want us here in Germany to be aware of this so we dont wake up one day and discover that our passion for paper files has blinded us to how quickly the world is turning in other places.   For example, in Kenya, where Ms Rotich hails from, mobile payment is already far more widespread than it is here in Germany.   You can receive and send money on your phone in Kenya, even if you dont have a bank account.   That enables you to pay bills and do other business transactions.   Without this, many micro-enterprises in Africa would go out of business or wouldnt exist in the first place.   Start-ups are breathing new life into Africas economy with innovative ideas and the use of key technologies such as blockchain and 3D printing.   Nairobi has been regarded as Silicon Savannah for years.   And co-working spaces have simply mushroomed.   Naturally, such developments are not found all over Africa.   But the potential for them exists in many places.   And this potential should be used.   The Strategic Partnership Digital Africa launched by the Federal Government also makes use of this potential.   It helps to forge ties between local partners and the European business and development cooperation sectors.   The aim is to develop business ideas and put them into practice.   I would also like to mention the initiative, Make-IT in Africa, through which the Federal Government has already helped over 190 tech start-ups in 23 African countries since 2017 to set up their business and make contacts.   We also strengthen local ecosystems for tech start-ups through this initiative.   As a co-founder of the iHub in Nairobi, Ms Rotich, you know how important strong networks and supportive institutions are.   When I was in Ghana last year, I spoke with several young entrepreneurs who have successfully launched their products and services on the market thanks to their truly astounding ideas.   They work in a very wide range of sectors, including renewable energies, food, agricultural technologies, health, education, and of course software.   However, these young entrepreneurs also told me about how hard it is to find investors.   That is precisely where our Compact with Africa comes in.   Twelve African countries are already part of it.   Our aim is to improve the parameters for long-term private-sector investment and employment.   I am pleased that I will have the opportunity to host the Heads of State and Government of the Compact with Africa countries again at a conference in Berlin in November.   In order to support the initiative, we have set up a new fund through which additional venture capital will be provided to existing African funds.   The target groups are African start-ups and micro-enterprises.   A lack of capital should not prevent good ideas from being turned into success stories.   Women in particular have good ideas that they can use to foster development and transformation.   That is why we also provide support from Germany to a large number of companies in Africa that were founded by women.   However, not only do we support female entrepreneurs at the national level, we also help them via multilateral initiatives, particularly through the G7 and the G20.   For example, we launched the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative at the G20 Summit in Hamburg in 2017.   By the way, the idea for this came from the Women20 Dialogue Forum I mentioned earlier on.   Another initiative is the #eSkills4Girls that we launched in Hamburg.   The idea here is to enable girls and women in developing and emerging countries to be able to make use of digital opportunities in the same way as boys and men.   And at this years G7 Summit in Biarritz, France, we expressly stated that one of our priorities is to promote female entrepreneurship.   On the German side, we underlined this statement with a pledge to provide 30 million euros to the African Development Banks funding programme for women.   We realise that we can provide incentives on the political side and improve the parameters for entrepreneurship.   In this way, we are also trying to  -  let me put it this way  -  persuade more and more German firms to do business with Africa.   You sometimes need to use the art of persuasion here because certain stereotypical images still prevail.   At the start of todays event, you saw a map that showed the world from the Germans perspective.   Unfortunately, it is still the case that many people associate Africa with problems rather than opportunities.   I can only urge us not to miss the boat here, but rather to recognise the opportunities in Africa.   We have a lot to do.   But role models like you, Ms Rotich, inspire and motivate us.   Your achievements also empower many other women.   You show what and how much one can change in the economy, society and other countries with good ideas and determination.   We need people like you who have the courage to try new things and thus inspire others to follow in their footsteps.   That is why I would like to say that the jury made an excellent decision in choosing to present the German Africa Award to Juliana Rotich.   I am certain that you will not only see this prize as a tribute to your hard work, but also as a motivation.   I am very interested to see what ideas you will come up with next.   I wish you every success.   Once again, allow me to offer you my warmest congratulations.   All the best! - - -","Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on the presentation of the German Africa Award to Juliana Rotich in Berlin on 23 October 2019",2019-10-23,"Germany","A.Merkel",1495,"en"
"50","doc97971","Mr Schuster, Ms Knobloch, Minister-President, Markus Söder, Members of the Bavarian Cabinet, President of the Landtag, Your Highness, Mr Mayor, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, Permit me to express my most sincere gratitude to the World Jewish Congress for presenting me with the Theodor Herzl Award.   I consider this to be a great honour.   I especially wish to thank you, Ambassador Lauder, for what you have you just said  -  for your words of generosity and appreciation, and also for your words of concern and warning.   When Theodor Herzl penned his book ""The Jewish State"" at the end of the 19century, he dreamed of a safe homeland for the worlds Jews in the face of widespread antisemitism.   Despite all of the discrimination and persecution, Herzl could not have foreseen even in his very worst nightmares what was to happen a little over three decades later, namely the betrayal of all civilised values that was the Shoa, committed in Germany during the National Socialist era.   This crime against humanity or  -  as the Auschwitz survivor and long-standing President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany Heinz Galinski once called it  -  ""this crime towards humanity"" involved breaking with all civilised principles.   It therefore fills me with humility that I, as Germanys Federal Chancellor  -  in other words, on behalf of our country  -  am able to accept the Theodor Herzl Award today.   I therefore consider this award ceremony to be a symbol of the trust that Jewish communities around the world and the World Jewish Congress in Germany place in Germany.   I cannot be grateful enough for this trust.   It is and remains something that cannot be taken for granted, and I continue to be greatly moved when people such as Margot Friedländer, who witnessed and survived the Shoah, decide after many decades and at a grand old age, to return from exile abroad to Germany, in Friedländers case to her home city of Berlin.   Almost 75 years after the end of the Holocaust, Jewish communities in Germany number 100,000 members once again.   The Israelite Congregation of Munich that we are visiting today is one of the biggest Jewish communities in Germany.   Ms Knobloch, thank you so much for being our host today and for preparing everything so wonderfully for us.   Please also extend our thanks to all of your staff.   The atmosphere here is quite wonderful.   At your centre, you can experience how diverse and vibrant Jewish life is in our country, and I have had an opportunity to gain an impression of this myself.   Rabbis are being ordained in Germany while Jewish kindergartens and educational institutions are being founded and synagogues reconstructed.   Jewish life, culture and history are part of Germanys identity, and Jewish life and Jewish culture must be supported.   It is with this in mind that the Federal Government recently increased funding for construction projects.   I need only mention the Federations involvement in the new construction of a synagogue in Dessau.   Jewish life in Germany must be both promoted and protected.   It is, unfortunately, a sad fact to have to emphasise how important protecting Jewish life is right now.   We have been aware of this not just since the attack on the synagogue in Halle on 9 October  -  Yom Kippur  -  which struck at the core of our entire society.   This horrific crime fills us with deep shame.   The fact that Jewish people are exposed to threats even in 2019 shows that we must never slacken our efforts to defend the fundamental values of our society and to apply them in our everyday lives.   It is over five years since we gathered for a major demonstration at the Brandenburg Gate in September 2014 in the wake of antisemitic incidents.   ""Stand up! Never again hatred of the Jews!""  -  that was the slogan we heard at the time.   I wish that I could say today that this appeal had borne lasting fruit, but, unfortunately, I cannot do that.   The scourge of antisemitism is still at large in Germany.   All of us must be greatly concerned by the most recent developments  -  and not only by the attack in Halle.   According to a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 89 percent of the Jewish people in Germany questioned perceived an increase in antisemitism.   The number of antisemitic crimes rose by almost 20 percent in the past year alone.   Antisemitic utterances are being made ever more frequently and without restraint  -  particularly on the internet.   These developments are deeply worrying.   They impact Jewish people in our country, but by no means them alone.   After all, they are targeted against all of us together, against Jewish and non-Jewish people, against everything that sustains and holds our country together, our values and freedoms.   They strike at the core of our coexistence as they are the expression of a deeply anti-democratic attitude.   Those who violate human dignity, enshrined in Article 1 of our Basic Law, violate the peaceful and thriving coexistence of us all.   The dignity of each individual human being shall be inviolable  -  this pledge at the beginning of our Basic Law is an obligation.   It applies to all people in our country, irrespective of their religion, skin colour, origin, gender or sexual orientation.   The fact that we have experienced how the promise of protection made by our country with respect to the Jews in Germany has not always been fully fulfilled  -  and instead, for example, only the strong wooden door of a synagogue saved the faithful gathered together in that place of worship from a massacre  -  weighs all the more heavily.   We must never accept that people in Germany have to live in fear on account of their religion.   Rather, we must do everything in our power to ensure that Jews in Germany can live in freedom and security.   Incidentally, antisemitism and racism are not first manifested in acts of violence, but much earlier, more subtly.   And we cannot wake up only when words give way to deeds.   We have to take action before then.   In a few days time, ladies and gentlemen, we will call to mind 9 November, which is such a fateful day in German history.   On the 80anniversary of the Reichspogromnacht, I had the honour last year to speak at the central commemorative event at the synagogue in Rykestraße in Berlin.   I would like to recapitulate a train of thought from this that continues to be important to me.   It had to do with the fact that we humans tend at important commemorative events such as 9 November to focus our minds exclusively on these days and easily overlook the fact that they usually do not happen in isolation, but are part of a wider process.   9 November 1938 did not occur in isolation.   We all know what happened next.   However, there was a pre-history to these events.   Hatred of the Jews has existed in Europe since the Middle Ages and was primarily religious at first.   Racially motivated antisemitism emerged in the 19century, during which social issues became pressing with the Industrial Revolution and secular nation states were in the ascendant.   All of this led to the cataclysm that culminated in the betrayal of all civilised values that was the Shoa.   I firmly believe that we can only learn the right lessons from the horrors of the past for us today and in the future if we consider the November pogroms of 1938 to be part of a process that was not only followed by the terrible chapter that was the Shoah, but also had a pre-history.   This pre-history was accompanied by a large majority of the German population looking the other way, remaining silent and indifferent and going with the flow.   Today, ladies and gentlemen, we are once again living at a time of profound technological and global change.   At times such as these, there is always a particularly great danger that those who respond to the difficulties and consequences of these upheavals with simple answers  -  simple answers that all too often go hand in hand with a brutalisation of language on the streets and the internet  -  gain in support.   We must take a firm stand against the onset of such trends.   And we means, first and foremost, our country.   I say this expressly in my capacity as Federal Chancellor.   Politicians and the state must protect their citizens with all the means available to a constitutional state.   Our constitutional state cannot stand idly by and allow people to be verbally abused, threatened or attacked when they profess to be Jewish.   It cannot stand idly by and allow a Jewish mother and her children to have stones thrown at them.   It cannot stand idly by and allow security personnel at the synagogue on Oranienburger Straße in Berlin to be attacked.   It is therefore vital that the Federal Government adopt its package of measures for tackling right-wing extremism and hate crime the day after tomorrow.   We will introduce a reporting obligation for providers.   Service providers are to be obligated to report hate crime on the internet to the security authorities.   We will set up a central office at the Federal Criminal Police Office to this end.   Stiffer penalties against hate speech and aggressive insults are also planned.   It is especially important that the dialogue among security authorities be strengthened in the fight against right-wing extremism.   The same goes for prevention work to tackle right-wing extremism, racism and antisemitism.   We will improve the protection of local politicians, i.  e.   those working on the ground in cities and communities and will adjust the criminal justice system to this end.   With this package of measures, we are doing everything in our power to ensure that words do not become deeds.   We will expand positive initiatives and existing measures.   And we will build up new structures where there are gaps.   Moreover, the office of the Federal Government Commissioner for Jewish Life in Germany and the Fight against Anti-Semitism was created at the beginning of this legislative term, in May 2018.   The Commissioner coordinates the various measures for tackling antisemitism and therefore does his part in working towards a package of measures for tackling right-wing extremism and hate crime.   In all that we are doing, we are taking the working definition of antisemitism of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance as our guide.   This working definition was adopted with Germanys support and the Federal Government endorsed it in 2017.   Incidentally, it is right that most of the fields of action for fighting antisemitism fall within the competence of the Länder.   However, it is also right that we are all resolved together not to be hampered in our fight against antisemitism and right-wing extremism by discussions on jurisdiction between the Federal Government and the Länder.   This is why we have a joint Federation-Länder Commission to fight antisemitism in which we are pooling all of our forces to tackle right-wing extremist and Islamist-motivated antisemitism  -  and also to tackle antisemitism that is targeted against the security and existence of the State of Israel.   European and international dialogue is indispensable to this end.   Regular consultations are therefore held with France and Israel on the issue of combating antisemitism.   Moreover, we want to strengthen European cooperation especially in this area during Germanys European Council Presidency in the second half of next year.   This is also important in view of the concerns of the Jewish community surrounding Islamist-motivated antisemitism as a result of the immigration and displacement of Muslim people to Germany.   It is good that we can count on support from strong and committed partners in civil society particularly in this regard.   I am thinking here, for example, of organisations that promote the Jewish-Muslim dialogue, of the Kreuzberg Initiative against Anti-Semitism that devises and implements educational projects, and also of the memorial sites that have developed special programmes on the issues of displacement and migration.   At the international level, the World Jewish Congress is a prominent partner in the fight against racism and antisemitism.   I am extremely grateful to the World Jewish Congress for its commitment to the concerns of Jewish people around the world.   Ladies and gentlemen, Theodor Herzls dream of a Jewish State of Israel became a reality with its foundation in 1948.   The fact that the State of Israel re-established diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany in 1965  -  20 years after the crimes against humanity that were the Shoah  -  was akin to a miracle.   At any rate, this was an incredible vote of confidence for our country.   We celebrated the 70 anniversary of the foundation of the State of Israel together last year.   Then as now, I reiterated the fact that Israels security is and remains part of Germanys raison détat.   Germany and Israel are united by countless economic, scientific and personal relations.   We are delighted to have such lively school and youth exchanges, and we have many town-twinning projects and friendship organisations.   The governments of both of our countries hold intergovernmental consultations on a regular basis.   Part of this is also the fact that the Federal Government continues, in spite of all the setbacks, to support a two-state solution  -  with Israel as a Jewish, democratic state in good neighbourliness with a viable Palestinian state.   Ladies and gentlemen, looking ahead, believing in a vision and making it a reality and working towards a bright future, full of conviction, with courage and creativity  -  these were features that distinguished Theodor Herzl.   And so I consider this award that you have presented me with today and which bears his name to be an obligation for me to never simply make do with what we have achieved, but to work together with our partners to promote a bright future.   I would like to pass on the recognition that the World Jewish Congress has expressed by awarding the Theodor Herzl Award to all people in Germany who are committed to exchange and understanding and to combating antisemitism and exclusion.   I would like to encourage all of them to continue to work with determination to promote the diversity and security of Jewish life in Germany.   And I want to continue to do my part to this end.   Thank you very much.   - - -","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the presentation of the Theodor Herzl Award in Munich on 28 October 2019",2019-10-28,"Germany","A.Merkel",2348,"en"
"51","doc97961","Mr Mathur, Mr Graf, Cabinet colleagues, Members of the business delegation, led by Mr Kaeser, Ambassador, Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be with you for a second time  -  this time in New Delhi  -  and to be opening with you what is now the 63Annual General Meeting of the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce.   The Indo-German Chamber of Commerce has not only been active for a long time; it is also the biggest German Chamber of Commerce Abroad.   And that is saying something, because there are over 140 of them, working in 92 countries around the world.   That in itself shows that India and Germany are good and reliable economic partners for each other.   There are some 1800 German companies operating in India.   One must never forget  -  and Im saying this to the German guests here today  -  that India is a continent of great diversity and regional divergence.   So it is no wonder that many different kinds of German companies are active here.   German firms provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in India.   I first came to India as Federal Chancellor in 2007.   I was able to be in attendance when we waved the Science Express off on its journey around the country, bringing the world of science closer to young people in particular.   Many companies were involved in the Science Express, alongside scientific institutions.   I mention that because I see the Science Express project as a fantastic symbol of the diversity of Indo-German relations  -  relations which we have been nurturing for many years and which were raised to a new level with the first intergovernmental consultations in 2011.   Yesterday we held the fifth Indo-German intergovernmental consultations.   My delegation and I received a very warm welcome from Prime Minister Modi and his Government.   Intergovernmental consultations have the advantage of covering the entire spectrum of cooperation  -  from issues relating to sustainable development, our economic relations, innovation and the digital transformation to, of course, foreign and security-policy challenges.   We have agreed to work even more closely together than hitherto on climate change mitigation and innovative technologies for more sustainability.   We decided to launch the Indo-German Partnership for Green Urban Mobility.   We will earmark one billion euros for this over the next five years.   What we intend to do, among other things, is put 500 new electric buses on the road in the state of Tamil Nadu and replace 2000 old diesel-engine buses with more energy-efficient models.   Anyone who noticed the air quality in Delhi yesterday will doubtless be well able to argue that there is a need for even more electric buses.   We also want to collaborate more closely on the digital transformation and artificial intelligence.   Here we have identified two areas which might be of great significance, if we get results.   Firstly, the health sector, and secondly, agriculture.   The Federal Minister of Agriculture is here today.   You are all aware of how hugely important agriculture is for India.   50% of the population work in agriculture.   Yields are by no means as good as they could be.   The losses after the harvest are substantial.   The entire logistical infrastructure needs to be improved.   And a great deal more can be done to encourage cooperation among the many small farmers in rural areas.   One has to recognise this: if nothing happens in the rural areas, people flood to urban areas, which then become completely overstretched.   In other words, any move to develop rural areas is also good news for sustainable development in urban areas.   That is why I think this is so important.   The digitalisation of agriculture will help not only to increase yields but also to make better use of fertilisers, pesticides and seeds, which will in turn protect the soil and the groundwater.   After all, water is an issue in many ways here in India.   The fact that the digital transformation opens up many possibilities in the health sector, too  -  for example, being able to evaluate huge quantities of data to gain knowledge for treatments  -  is of course clear.   So I am very interested to learn about the findings of the newly-agreed Digital Expert Group, an initiative of German and Indian companies and research institutions which is to draw up proposals for joint projects and policy measures to be presented to the German and Indian Governments.   Perhaps you as the Chamber of Commerce Abroad can take a more detailed look at our various projects and see whether there is anything among them for you, and perhaps where something more could be done over and above your own current engagement.   Ladies and gentlemen, German and Indian companies work together for many reasons; the motivations for German companies to be present here in India are many.   Over the past 20 years the country has boasted an impressive growth rate of seven percent.   The Indian market is not only enormous, but also very dynamic.   That is why you are interested, and that is why I am accompanied on this trip by a business delegation, many of whom  -  with the exception of Mr Kaeser, who represents a huge company, Siemens  -  are from SMEs and naturally have to learn how to navigate Indias labyrinthine bureaucracy.   That is why, at yesterdays roundtable with Prime Minister Modi, we did not hesitate to speak very frankly about the various obstacles our companies come up against in India, but also about those which Indian companies find in Europe.   Because Europe has plenty of red tape too.   We will be talking to the European Commission once again to see whether it might not be possible to simplify certain things.   We believe there are good openings for German engagement in the further modernisation of Indian infrastructure, particularly the planned high-speed rail links.   We also want to help shape urbanisation, promoting smart cities and renewable energy sources.   Indias renewables capacity amounts to approximately 75 gigawatts.   But that is just a drop in the ocean for such a big country with its population of 1.  4 billion.   We have the same in Germany, with our population of 83 million.   But it is good that a further 100 gigawatts are to be added in the coming years.   I am told again and again that water and waste management is a huge issue.   Germany has excellent technologies to offer in this area.   However, we have to say  -  this is what companies all tell us  -  that while everything already works really well B2B, when it comes to waste management in towns and cities, in other words when the customers are the inhabitants, there are a whole range of problems, because pricing certain public services is no easy matter when you are dealing with areas with very different lifestyles, backgrounds and incomes.   In better-off parts of town, you could certainly charge prices that reflect the services provided.   In other parts of town that would be much more problematic.   In Chile we saw how increasing the price of an underground ticket by four cents can very rapidly cause major social dislocation.   This is certainly not a very easy matter.   In the long term, however, environmental services, waste collection, electricity, etcetera need to be naturally priced, otherwise things will not work properly.   Now we know, of course, that good intentions alone are not enough.   That is why we have established an instrument, the fast track procedure.   When an investment stalls, a way to the Prime Ministers office can be found via the Embassy or Ambassador Lindner, and then these cases can be examined to see what the difficulty is thats holding things up.   The German business community has said it would be ideal to have such an instrument in every state of India, because many decisions are taken at state level.   We want to continue working on that.   In addition, we need new rules to protect German investment.   The old regulation expired in 2016.   What we need even more urgently  -  as I discussed in detail yesterday with the Prime Minister  -  is to restart the negotiations with the European Union on an EU-India free trade agreement.   At one point we were quite close to doing so, but then a few points of contention emerged, relating in particular to access to public procurement, and to agriculture.   However, we have undertaken to make a fresh attempt with the new European Commission, not least because the Trade Commissioner in the new Commission used to be Agriculture Commissioner in the old Commission and is very familiar with the subject.   We, India and Germany, are firmly committed to the multilateral trade system.   German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and his French counterpart held a meeting on the fringes of the UN General Assembly for countries committed to multilateralism.   I am happy to say that India was one of them.   We want to strengthen multilateralism.   Prime Minister Modi and I were agreed on this yesterday.   As a strong economy and populous nation, India is becoming increasingly prominent in international cooperation.   Naturally this also means that the country has an increased responsibility in international affairs.   We already work together in various UN-led maritime missions.   We have a shared interest in the development of Afghanistan.   Obviously it is always also a matter of ensuring fair relations between states.   Clearly this is only possible if states understand each other, and if they are willing to seek a fair accommodation of interests and to try to find solutions through dialogue.   This represents a position which India embodies worldwide in the great figure of Mahatma Gandhi, whose 150birthday we are celebrating this year.   And so it was a very special moment for me yesterday when, along with Prime Minister Modi, I visited the last house Gandhi lived in, Gandhi Smriti.   Thank you very much indeed for giving me that opportunity.   This year, indeed, we are marking several anniversaries.   Thirty years ago, the Berlin Wall fell.   Seventy years ago, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded.   Two years before that, in 1947, India attained independence.   And in 1951, Germany and India established diplomatic relations.   These were important milestones.   Since then, the Chambers of Commerce Abroad have done wonderful work.   I wish once again to tell all of you here, and especially the Committee, that we very much appreciate it.   Alongside the political Ambassador, you too are important ambassadors in India, this great country.   I can reveal that you might be facing even more work.   Because we recently adopted an immigration act for skilled workers.   I believe the fact that there are now almost 20,000 Indian students in Germany is in itself good news.   More and more universities are offering courses in English, meaning that there is no longer such a big language barrier as there once was.   Though we are happy about every student who decides to learn German.   The Goethe-Institut does a lot to encourage people to learn the language.   You no longer necessarily have to be able to speak fluent German to do an apprenticeship in Germany.   The first priority is specialist know-how, and then your knowledge of German becomes more important and your skills improve.   Our proposal is that the Chambers of Commerce Abroad be a point of contact for people who want to go to Germany as skilled workers, in other words that they act as a kind of job broker, and then fill out the visa applications in close cooperation with the Embassies.   We all know, after all, that some people complain about how long it takes to process a visa application.   In order for the immigration act for skilled workers to function properly, we want to introduce a mechanism that will work right from the word go as of March next year.   We will be discussing this with the German business community at the end of the year.   I can imagine there might definitely be a certain interest on the Indian side in sending skilled workers to Germany.   In 2022, India will celebrate 75 years of independence and in that same year will assume the G20 Presidency.   Germany will hold the G7 Presidency then.   We will have to think about what Indo-German highlights we can arrange for that year.   I would like to conclude by saying I at least am convinced that our cooperation has a great deal more potential.   In 2030 India will have a bigger population than China.   Following Mr Modis second election, India will strengthen its international role.   India has a young population who want to live in prosperity but who also want to work hard.   And so you deserve our gratitude for creating jobs here, and for passing on your experience, hopefully while making money here in India.   Of course we want that too.   Let us work together to make relations between our two countries even stronger, even more vibrant and even more intensive.   The political will is certainly there, as emphasised by these Indo-German intergovernmental consultations.   Thank you very much for inviting me to be with you at the opening of your Annual General Meeting today.   - - -","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the 63rd Annual General Meeting of the Indo‑German Chamber of Commerce in New Delhi on 2 November 2019",2019-11-02,"Germany","A.Merkel",2156,"en"
"52","doc97951","Presidents, Prime Ministers and Ministers, Excellencies, Professor Grosse, Professor Liebing, Fellow members of the Cabinet and the German Bundestag, Ladies and gentlemen, Let me start with a very special greeting for the President of Egypt, Mr al-Sisi, who is not only the Chairperson of the African Union this year, but is also celebrating his 65birthday here in Germany today.   Many happy returns, Mr President, and all good wishes on your birthday.   I am delighted to be opening this conference with you today, and particularly with the many guests from the Compact with Africa countries.   I extend a very warm welcome to Berlin especially to the Heads of State and Government.   I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the organisers, the German-African Business Association and the Sub-Saharan Africa Initiative of German Business.   Today we are meeting in the House of German Business, where the German business associations are gathered under one roof.   So you could say we are right at the heart of the home of German business.   Be it peace, climate protection, economic development, migration or other major questions of our time  -  we all agree that Africa, with its more than 50 states and a growing population  -  indeed an increasingly young population  -  has an important role to play in tackling global issues.   It is clear that Africans and Europeans are facing many shared challenges.   This is why we have intensified our cooperation considerably in recent years  -  because we firmly believe that it is not only in the African interest, but also in the interest of Europes biggest economy, in Germanys interest.   I have been able to visit some countries in Africa, but unfortunately nowhere near all of them, not even half of them.   But I am pleased that African Heads of State and Government pay very frequent visits to Germany.   I am aware that one always has work to do at home.   So I am grateful that you have taken the time to come.   We are agreed that as well as engaging in development assistance, of course we need above all to shape the transition to a self-sustaining upturn.   That was one of the reasons why we launched the Compact with Africa Initiative during our G20 Presidency in 2017.   The aim is to increase private investment in particular in the participating countries.   We know that in the past few years the African states have set themselves a very ambitious agenda.   The most recent highlight, I would say, was the African Union Summit in Niamey, in the Niger, where the final decision was taken on the launch of an African Continental Free Trade Area.   I believe this decision, alongside the regional organisations which are already very strong and active on the African continent, was a landmark one.   And I congratulate you on it.   With the European internal market, we have a bit of an idea just how hard it is to get something like that up and running.   There are customs barriers, but above all there are lots of non-tariff trade barriers that you have to wrestle with.   We Europeans have to admit that even after many years of the European Union, we still dont have a perfect single market.   All the issues relating to the single market are coming to the fore again now, not least in relation to the digital transformation.   Yesterday the governing coalition was looking at digital issues facing Germany.   We were joined by the representative of Smart Africa, who was appointed by the African Union to accelerate digitalisation, and who told us about what you have been doing in this area.   It was certainly very encouraging.   The yardstick for the initiatives is, in particular, your Agenda 2063, launched with the 100jubilee of decolonisation as its horizon.   Yesterday we also spoke with Mr Koné of Smart Africa about what digital sovereignty means.   Because it is possible to become hugely dependent on others again even in the digital age.   Data  -  the ""new oil"", as it was called yesterday  -  might suddenly not belong to us any more.   That is a problem that exists in Europe as well as in Africa.   So that is a field where cooperation is definitely worthwhile.   Now we have the Compact with Africa.   Twelve countries are participating.   The idea was, is and will remain a G20 initiative.   It is not, in other words, a purely German initiative: it is supported by all G20 states.   But because it was launched during our Presidency, we are, if I may put it this way, a sort of patron of this initiative.   However, its main supporters now include the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.   And indeed guests from those institutions will be with us this afternoon.   This initiative means, on the one hand, that the African countries themselves are taking steps to improve the transparency of their financial systems, to improve their tax systems and to improve debt management.   So overall a lot is being done for better governance.   We believe, I am firmly convinced, that greater transparency can also bring more investors into these countries, because it is very important especially for German SMEs or investors from other G20 states that there is confidence, that there is transparency, that it is clear what environment one is investing in.   On the other hand, we want to create incentives for the countries participating in the Compact with Africa, when they see some success, to grant our countries better conditions for investment.   To this end, we have set up an investment fund.   I would just like to remind you  -  as the fund was basically designed last year  -  of the pillars on which it is based.   The first is AfricaConnect.   This financing solution is intended to help SMEs from Germany and Europe to finance investment in Compact countries.   We launched it in June, and have already received over 220 inquiries.   The first commitments will be made soon.   And a few of these investment projects will be presented here today.   The second pillar is the Africa Business Network ( ), which provides German companies with tailormade advice on funding possibilities and on the economic and legal environment in African countries.   The third pillar is the AfricaGrow development investment fund.   Through this fund and trusted African funds, we will provide venture capital for African start-ups  -  another very important element.   I spoke only recently with this years recipient of the German Africa Award, Juliana Rotich, about the problems in getting loans locally.   Now AfricaGrow gives African start-ups the possibility of easier access to funding.   In addition, we have made the conditions for export guarantees and investment guarantees more attractive.   Since 2018, exports totalling 330 million euros to Compact countries alone have enjoyed Federal guarantees.   Applications have been submitted for a billion euros in guarantees.   So we are improving; we started off from a fairly low level, compared to China and other countries.   We also know that foreign trade is often the precursor to engagement on the ground, for instance in the form of investment.   Thats why these figures are definitely promising.   Furthermore, we have taken a look at how the Compact countries ratings in the World Banks Ease of Doing Business Index, which is important to many investors, have evolved over the past few years.   And we can say that the ratings of the Compact countries in particular have improved greatly.   Allow me to congratulate everyone on that.   So we can now point to a host of practical examples, and, should you want to find out more, you can have a look at the information in the atrium.   Of course, the decision to invest in Africa remains one for the private sector.   We cannot take the decision for businesses.   We can, however, help.   We can create confidence, and we can say that conditions in the Compact states are certainly more transparent than they used to be.   In another step, we  -  in the form of Gerd Müller and his team at the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development  -  have entered into bilateral reform partnerships with some of the Compact countries, namely Ghana, Tunisia, Côte dIvoire and now also Senegal and Ethiopia.   We can also say that the possibility of a reform partnership is open to all.   We are talking about the conditions, and the Minister is speaking to many representatives of the other Compact countries too.   You will realise that there has been a great deal of movement; but I do not wish to paint too positive a picture, because there are still problems that need to be solved.   These include the major issue of security, in the Sahel region in particular.   Here we have different instruments to try and make security and development compatible.   The challenges posed by terrorism are severe.   And then there is the matter of population growth.   Africa has a young and incredibly proactive population.   Basically the exact opposite from what we have in Germany.   We talk a great deal about how many pensioners we are going to have in future.   In Africa, though, they talk more about young people.   That is why I am pleased about the cross-border special initiative on Training and Employment, which aims to create 100,000 jobs and 30,000 training places.   I would also like to remind you of the Federal Governments decision to introduce an immigration act for skilled workers.   From 1 March 2020, we will for the first time have rules on how skilled workers can move to Germany.   As Mr Grosse has already indicated, our Chambers of Commerce Abroad will be the points of contact.   We will join with the German business community to organise a large-scale forum before the end of December to consider what countries we want to advertise in for skilled workers, and generally how we are going to go about it.   Ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that my speech is not the main event this morning.   Rather, we are going to be learning about concrete projects for individual Compact countries.   In other words, of course, we are going to be learning more about your countries.   And so I would like to close by quoting an African saying: ""If you want to know how business is going at the market, you have to go down there.  "" Its as simple as that.   True, today the market is being shifted here to Berlin for us, but if we really want to know about it, then, yes, we need to go there.   On that note: thank you very much, particularly to our guests who have travelled a long way.   I hope we will all enjoy a successful conference.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the Investment Summit of the G20 Compact with Africa in Berlin on 19 November 2019",2019-11-19,"Germany","A.Merkel",1757,"en"
"53","doc97941","Secretary-General Guterres, António, Ministers, Excellencies, Members of Parliament from around the world, Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to Berlin! I and the entire Federal Government are pleased that you have made your way here, bringing your ideas for the future of the internet.   Thank you very much for coming! What the Secretary-General of the United Nations said a few moments ago is quite correct: he was an electrical engineer, and I was a physicist, and then we took a bit of a detour.   True.   But perhaps its no bad thing for technical developments in our age if there are a few politicians who know something about technology  -  though in my case only the basics remain; doubtless its different for António  -  and who are working together to understand our world.   This is already the 14Annual Meeting of the United Nations Internet Governance Forum, but this is the first time it has been held here in Germany.   Particularly as this years host, but also even after this conference week ends, we want to help revitalise and shape the global exchange about values and rules on the internet.   It is, after all, becoming more and more important for all of us to join together to discuss how we want to shape and use the internet of the future.   When I say ""all of us"", I mean policymakers and civil society, business and the scientific community.   ""All of us"" also means that all countries need to work together.   That is the principle underlying multilateralism.   That is the principle on which the United Nations builds.   And that is also the basis from which we must steer new technological developments.   That is precisely what makes the IGF so valuable.   It provides a forum where internet governance actors from all over the world can discuss their experiences and ideas.   Basically, this is where the analogue and digital worlds melt into one.   ""One World.   One Net.   One Vision.  "" This years slogan sums it up neatly: we want to arrive at a shared understanding of what the internet of the future should look like.   What values, principles and rules do we want to take with us from our analogue world to the digital world? What processes and procedures will we need in doing so? The one value which has particularly accelerated the internets triumph is this: freedom.   We know that freedom is never something that can be taken for granted; we have to keep on fighting for it and defending it.   Together we constantly have to clarify where and how freedom needs to be protected, was freedom means in concrete terms, and also where its boundaries lie  -  in other words, what is and is not allowed when fundamental rights of others, for instance children, have to be upheld or if fundamental rights of others are violated.   That is where the boundaries of freedom lie.   This month in particular, as we saw in the introductory film, we Germans have been reflecting and talking a great deal about just what freedom means for our country.   The Berlin Wall fell 30 years ago, in November 1989.   The strong desire for freedom felt by the people in the GDR and our neighbours in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and the three Baltic states could no longer be suppressed by coercive state measures.   Here in Berlin you can see very clearly what the division of Germany and Europe meant for the people.   One of the former border crossing points between East and West Berlin is just a few hundred metres away from here.   And as you make your way into this venue, you can see a few pieces of the Wall, each of them weighing tonnes.   But freedom carried and still carries much more weight.   You may be interested to know that I did my scientific work just a few hundred metres from here, in the eastern part of Berlin.   I never saw the Sonnenallee from this side, but my workplace was not far from here.   The Wall and the Iron Curtain were torn down 30 years ago.   The peoples striving for freedom and self-determination had prevailed.   Our country and also our European continent could finally grow together again.   Freedom of travel, freedom of the press, freedom of opinion, freedom to choose an occupation, the right to free development of the personality: all these and other fundamental rights would now apply in Europe again.   Freedom and the hope of progress for all  -  that was also the vision of the inventor of the internet 50 years ago and of the World Wide Web 30 years ago.   And some of the inventors are here with us today.   The technology of the internet was developed in such a way that it can transcend territorial borders, can easily be used in all corners of the globe, and can link all human beings.   There are now four billion internet users.   António Guterres has pointed out how much faster this process evolved than printing and the spread of books did.   By 2030, so in just over ten years, the figure is expected to be seven billion.   We are all benefiting from this global connectivity.   People from very different countries and cultures are meeting across perceived analogue barriers  -  barriers created by politics, religion or social status.   The truth is that the internet has long since reached every aspect of our daily lives  -  at least in the case of those who use it.   Fewer and fewer people can imagine communicating, working or shopping without using the internet at all.   And just as we naturally and unthinkingly use the internet round the clock, so we naturally and unthinkingly regard it as a global network in which geographical distance is now largely irrelevant.   Flows of data and information connect cities, countries and continents.   It is interesting that geographical distances, for instance that need to be covered with a network of underwater cables, do in fact still play a role when it comes to the actual technology.   Many of the data links between North and South America go via the cable landing point in Fortaleza, Brazil.   The data flow between Europe and Asia goes via underwater cables in the Suez Canal.   A whole cluster of cables linking the Asia-Pacific region make landfall in Singapore.   Another example is internet exchange points, where internet providers link up with the global network, making internet access possible.   Three of the biggest internet exchanges are in Europe  -  in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London.   They will keep us connected even after the United Kingdom has left the European Union.   This shared internet infrastructure has become a cornerstone of the global economy.   It is of vital importance for sustainable development and innovation worldwide.   Billions of people can make their views and ideas known on the internet.   They can communicate, exchange information and compare experiences.   The internet is home to democratic debate and political opinion-forming  -  for good and not so good, because, as the Secretary-General also pointed out, there are some people who stay in their own bubble and no longer engage at all with anyone who takes a different view.   This is one of the challenges the internet presents us with.   But there are other reasons, too, why a free and open internet and the internets many decentralised structures are a thorn in the side of some people.   Non-democratic states and their governments are interfering with the freedoms the internet creates.   They are trying to push through their own or national interests and, to this end, to seal their nets off from the global internet.   Even some private companies are investing in their own, closed-off infrastructures.   This raises the danger that global companies might build up parallel worlds  -  with their own rules and standards  -  which they will then try to impose on others via international bodies.   This is a very difficult topic.   I understand that this forum wants to confront precisely this issue.   Because, if I can put it this way, we have to clarify what we mean when, on the one hand, we want to retain our digital sovereignty but, on the other, we want to act multilaterally, and not shut ourselves off.   Of course digital sovereignty is very important.   But it may be that we all have come to understand something different by that, even though we are using the same term.   As I understand it, digital sovereignty does not mean protectionism, or that state authorities say what information can be disseminated  -  censorship, in other words; rather, it describes the ability both of individuals and of society to shape the digital transformation in a self-determined way.   So, in the digital world as elsewhere, technological innovation has to be in the service of humanity, not the other way around.   Having found success with the social market economy system, we in Germany know that technological innovations do not just happen, that companies do not simply evolve automatically, but that they always need parameters and guidelines.   That was the case in the industrial revolution, and it will need to be the same in the internet age.   In other words, we need sovereignty over what happens.   And so, if we are convinced that isolationism is not an expression of sovereignty, but that we have to base our actions on a shared understanding and shared values, then precisely that  -  a commitment to a shared, free, open and secure global internet  -  is in fact an expression of sovereignty.   Because what would the consequences be if we went down the road of isolationism? To my mind, the consequences of an increasingly fragmented internet can never be good.   They can be many and varied, but never good.   The global infrastructure could become unstable and vulnerable to attack.   There would be more surveillance.   The state would increasingly filter and censor information.   Perhaps the internet and mobile phone networks would even be shut down in order to prevent the people from communicating.   This means that an attack on internet connectivity, the foundation for a free and open internet, has become a dangerous political instrument.   Many people have first-hand experience of what thats like.   Attacks like this can deprive the people of their fundamental rights to information and communication.   This turns the idea underlying the internet, the idea of its inventors, completely on its head.   And so we should all be determined to protect the heart of the internet as a global public good.   We can only do that if we think again about the governance structures of this global network that links us all.   But how can we counter the efforts of individual states to split off from the free internet or shape it on their own? I believe we can do so by realising that just as the strength of networks is measured by the number of their users, so we need the efforts of many to preserve a cross-border, decentralised internet.   In other words: by realising that we have to act multilaterally.   Only in this way can we develop a shared, cross-border understanding and appreciation of the value of a free internet.   And so I warmly welcome the UN Secretary-Generals announcement that he will be appointing an envoy for these talks, who will have his full confidence.   During Germanys G20 Presidency in 2017 we established a ""digital strand"" in the G20.   Of course we are aware that the G20 states do not represent the entire world.   But it would already be a big step forward if agreement on this important issue could be reached within that group.   For this reason, I am pleased that we have got important commitments from the G20 states, including on global connectivity and on international standards.   How did we manage to do this? Mainly because we also involved civil society and the business community.   Governments alone cannot succeed.   That is why I find it so important that civil society and business are always involved in the G20 process  -  especially, as António Guterres pointed out, women, who risk being left behind in the new value chains created by the internet.   So, the internet cannot and must not be shaped by states and governments alone.   Because the fundamental issues surrounding the internet ultimately affect each and every one of us.   Thats why we need a comprehensive dialogue and a multi-stakeholder approach, as we say these days  -  in other words, exactly the approach taken by the IGF.   And so I am very grateful that you have gathered here in Berlin to present your view of matters.   Of course this is a new approach.   The traditional multilateral structures only know cooperation between governments.   But I dont believe that alone is enough nowadays.   That is why we have to keep on pushing this broad-based approach.   If we can use the internet globally or if we want to use the internet globally, then we also have to think globally.   The internet affects everyone, even people with no access to it.   And so we have to improve internet access and equal participation in the digital transformation.   The question of inclusion is one of the topics you will be discussing intensively over the next few days.   I was very happy to learn, at a Federal Government closed meeting a few days ago, that there are plans to create a comprehensive digital market in Africa, that there is a digital commissioner, and that within the African Union the intention is not only to engage in free trade in the traditional sense but also to focus on digital development, one element being inclusive internet access.   António Guterres, you have worked with international experts from the fields of policymaking, business, academia and civil society to produce a report on digital cooperation.   Thanks to your proposals for new approaches to shaping the common digital future, an important debate is gathering pace.   In talking about internet governance, we must first agree on values.   We must agree on how to protect human rights, democracy and the rule of law in the digital age, and on how to strengthen equal participation and security on the net, as well as confidence in the net.   Of course we will have to blaze new trails.   Normally, you see, we are used to translating everything we agree in international treaties or agreements into national legislation.   This time, however, more is needed.   The business community needs to be involved, and so do the people  -  and of course this cannot be ensured through laws alone.   The challenge is considerable.   The digital transformation poses fundamental questions for our societies.   By no means everything that is feasible online or technically possible is ethically desirable.   That is something, by the way, that we know even from the pre-digital world.   These are questions we will have to discuss in depth, particularly with an eye to artificial intelligence.   We will have to talk not only about what we want, but also about what we dont want.   For example, if I may: there are some in the community who would rather talk about what is possible than about what we do not want to do with the new technical possibilities.   Even though it is not about interfering with the internet, but about the principle that technology is there to serve the people.   All this can only work if everyone works together: governments, international organisations and formats, and civil society, must be equally involved in discussions.   If we are honest, and looking just at my own country, then it has to be said that we have not yet reached consensus among all sides.   We saw this in the debate on copyright in the European Union, for instance, and also in connection with the General Data Protection Regulation.   So there are a great number of things still the subject of much heated debate.   That is why we must be prepared to organise new opportunities for participation in which every voice is heard and every voice is equal.   In other words, we need real cooperation.   We also need discourse skills.   Entrenching ourselves in internet bubbles where our own viewpoint holds sway is definitely not the way to solve the problems.   It is in this spirit that the Internet Governance Forum here in Berlin is breaking new ground.   I regard it as an important signal that parliamentarians from all over the world have travelled to Berlin in response to an initiative by Federal Economic Affairs Minister Peter Altmaier.   In democratic terms, too, this is a huge boon.   Moreover, we, the German Government, never regard the digital transformation as something to be dealt with at national level; rather, we always also think on a European level.   Because Europes ideas can make a major contribution to the shared global vision of the future of the internet.   Overall, though, reshaping internet governance is of course a matter that will require global efforts.   It will require states and stakeholders to stand shoulder to shoulder.   Germany is ready to help shape a new global internet policy under the auspices of the United Nations.   We are convinced that the United Nations and the IGF have a key role to play in bringing about a global consensus in favour of an open, free and decentralised internet.   On that note, ladies and gentlemen, I wish you every success here at the Internet Governance Forum in Berlin.   Take a little bit of inspiration from this place where 30 years ago the fall of the Wall ushered in a new age.   We in the former GDR never thought we would see the Wall fall in our lifetime.   But it did happen  -  thanks to many courageous people and some favourable circumstances.   So one never knows whether the courage of an individual or of many individuals might not suddenly open up paths which at present appear virtually inaccessible.   So please speak freely and frankly in the workshops, panel discussions and meetings.   I wish you a week of interesting encounters with people whom you perhaps otherwise only know from the internet.   Communication doesnt always have to be digital; you can go for a beer or a glass of wine in one of Berlins great pubs and restaurants.   Enjoy Berlin.   Thank you very much.   All the best.   - - -","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel opening the 14th Annual Meeting of the Internet Governance Forum in Berlin on 26 November 2019",2019-11-26,"Germany","A.Merkel",3016,"en"
"54","doc97931","Prime Minister, Director, Excellencies, Above all, survivors, Ladies and gentlemen, To stand here today and address you as Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany is far from easy.   I am filled with a deep shame at the barbaric crimes committed here by Germans, crimes that defy all comprehension.   One ought actually to fall silent in horror at what was done to women, men and children here in this place.   Because what words could adequately express the grief? The grief over all those many people who were humiliated, tortured and murdered here? And yet, hard as it is in this place, more representative than any of the worst crime against humanity, silence must not be our only response.   This site obliges us to keep the memory alive.   We must remember the crimes that were committed here and name them clearly.   Auschwitz.   This name stands for the millions of European Jews who were murdered, for the betrayal of all civilised values that was the Shoah.   Auschwitz stands too for the genocide of Europes Sinti and Roma, for the suffering and murder of political prisoners and members of Polands intelligentsia, of resistance fighters, prisoners of war from the Soviet Union and other countries, homosexuals, people with disabilities and countless other people from all over Europe.   The suffering of the people in Auschwitz, their deaths in the gas chambers, hunger, cold, epidemics, agonising pseudo-medical experiments, forced labour to the point of utter exhaustion  -  what happened here is beyond human comprehension.   At least 1.  1 million people, the majority of them Jews, were methodically and ruthlessly systematically murdered in the Auschwitz camp complex alone.   Every one of those people had a name, an inalienable dignity, a history, a story.   The very manner of deporting them here, crowded into cattle wagons, the procedures on arrival and the so-called selection on the ramp  -  all were designed to dehumanise them, to rob them of their dignity and their individuality.   This site is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List with the official name ""Auschwitz-Birkenau  -  German Nazi Concentration and Extermination Camp (1940-1945)"".   It is important that this is its full name.   Oświęcim is in Poland, but in October 1939 Auschwitz was annexed as part of the German Reich.   Auschwitz was a German extermination camp, operated by Germans.   It is important to me to emphasise that fact.   It is important to identify the perpetrators clearly.   We Germans owe that to the victims, and to ourselves.   Remembering the crimes, naming the perpetrators and commemorating the victims in dignity is an unending responsibility.   It is non-negotiable, and it belongs inseparably to our country.   Being aware of this responsibility is an integral part of our national identity and defines who we are as an enlightened and liberal society, a democracy and a state based on the rule of law.   Today Jewish life is again flourishing in Germany.   We enjoy wide-ranging friendly relations with Israel.   That is by no means something we can take for granted.   It is a precious gift.   It is, indeed, something of a miracle.   But it cannot undo what has been done.   It cannot bring back the murdered Jews.   There will always be a gaping void in our society.   The Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany entered into force 70 years ago.   It took on board the lessons learnt from the horrors of the past.   However, we also know that while the inalienable dignity of the individual, freedom, democracy and the rule of law are precious values, they are also vulnerable.   That is why we must consolidate and enhance, protect and defend these fundamental values  -  both in our day-to-day coexistence and in government activity and political discourse.   These days, this is not mere rhetoric.   These days, it is necessary to say this clearly.   Because we are experiencing worrying racism, increasing intolerance and a wave of hate crimes.   We are seeing an attack on the fundamental values of liberal democracy and a dangerous historical revisionism stoking forms of hostility directed at specific groups.   We pay particular attention to antisemitism, which threatens Jewish life in Germany, Europe and beyond.   And so we need to state this more clearly: we will not tolerate antisemitism.   Everyone must be able to feel safe and at home in Germany, in Europe.   Auschwitz in particular serves as a warning and obliges each and every one of us to be alert every day, to preserve humanity and to protect our neighbours dignity.   Because, as Primo Levi, who was born in Turin 100 years ago and who survived Auschwitz as a forced labourer in Monowitz, later wrote: ""It happened, therefore it can happen again.  "" So we cannot close our eyes and ears when people are being verbally abused, humiliated or marginalised.   We must confront those who stir up prejudice and incite hatred against people of different faiths or origins.   We all of us bear responsibility.   And that responsibility includes remembrance.   We must never forget.   No line can ever be drawn under this past, nor can it ever be downplayed.   Or in the words of Noach Flug, an Auschwitz survivor and former President of the International Auschwitz Committee: ""Memory [.  .  .  ] is like water: it is essential to life and it finds its own way to new spaces and to different people.   [.  .  .  ] It has no expiry date, and you cannot decree that it has been dealt with or brought to a conclusion.  "" Thanks in particular to the many testimonies of survivors, this memory which is essential to life, seeks  -  as Noach Flug said  -  and indeed finds ways.   I am therefore very pleased to greet some of them here today.   Over the years, you have talked about the suffering you endured many times, and you have told us again today.   Who can imagine how much strength it takes to live through these painful experiences time and again or even to return to this place? You share your story so that young people can learn from it.   You summon up the courage and strength to foster reconciliation.   You have truly shown human greatness.   I am very grateful that we can hear and learn from you.   We will soon be marking the 75anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.   Ever fewer individuals can tell their story from this time.   This prompted the author Navid Kermani to very aptly say: ""[.  .  .  ] In order to ensure that a memory connected to the memorials, Stolpersteine (stumbling stones) and commemorative ceremonies is etched in our hearts, it will be even more important for future generations to see with their own eyes the places where Germany crushed human dignity, to travel to those countries which it drenched in blood.  "" In many places, the perpetrators tried to cover their tracks  -  be it in extermination camps such as Bełżec, Sobibór and Treblinka, be it in places such as Maly Trostenets, Babi Yar or in the thousands of other places around Europe where Jews, Sinti and Roma, many others and even whole villages were murdered.   Here in Auschwitz, however, the SS and their henchmen did not manage to wipe out all traces of what they had done.   This place bears witness to what happened.   And this must be preserved.   Anyone who comes to Auschwitz and sees the watchtowers and the barbed wire, the barracks and the cells, the remains of the gas chambers and the crematoriums, will never be able to forget it.   It will, as Kermani wrote, ""be etched in their hearts"".   Ten years ago, the former Polish Foreign Minister Władysław Bartoszewski, who was himself a political prisoner in Auschwitz, initiated the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation.   Mr Cywínski, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to you and to everyone in the Foundation who have made it their mission to conserve this place as a memorial and documentation centre.   I would also like to thank everyone involved in the restoration and conservation projects.   You have been working with great dedication to ensure that this place continues to bear witness.   Brick barracks have been restored to secure their long-term conservation, excavations have been carried out, supporting walls installed, protective tents put up, the stolen clothes and belongings of the victims restored and conserved.   The Foundation capital will have to be substantially increased in order to fund the conservation plans for the next 25 years.   Germany will make a significant contribution.   This was decided yesterday together with the Minister-Presidents of the Länder.   Thanks to the Foundation, as well as the many international guides, this memorial is a place of learning, of remembrance and of awareness  -  a place which so impressively conveys the message: ""Never again"".   For that I am profoundly grateful.   However, nothing can bring back the people who were murdered here.   Nothing can reverse the crimes committed here, crimes that are without parallel.   They are and will remain part of German history.   This history must be told, time and again, so that we remain vigilant, so that such crimes are not repeated, not even on a lesser scale, so that we can take resolute action against racism and antisemitism in all their abhorrent forms.   This history has to be told so that today and in the future we can protect the dignity of every individual and so that we honour the memory of the victims.   We remember the people who were deported to Auschwitz from many different countries across Europe.   At this site, we remember in particular the many Polish victims, including political prisoners, for whom Auschwitz concentration camp was originally built.   We remember the six million murdered Jews and here in particular the around one million Jews who were murdered in Auschwitz-Birkenau.   We remember the Sinti and Roma who were deported, tormented and murdered.   We remember the victims of mass shootings.   We remember those who were deported to ghettos, remained in hiding while fearing for their lives and those who had to flee their homes.   We remember all those who lost everything: their friends and families, their countries and their homes, their hopes and plans, their trust, their zest for life and their dignity.   We remember those who wandered around for years after the war and those who had to remain in camps for displaced persons.   Those who survived were severely affected by the horrors they had experienced.   Margot Friedländer wrote in her memoir that they first of all had to learn again that they were human beings, human beings with a name.   Many asked themselves why they had survived.   Why not their little sister? Why not their best friend? Why not their own mother or their husband? Many of them only learned later, or not at all, how and where their loved ones had been murdered.   Such wounds never heal.   I would thus like to express my heartfelt thanks to those who have managed to talk about their experiences, to share their memories and their pain and to foster reconciliation.   I bow my head before these individuals.   I bow my head before the victims of the Shoah.   I bow my head before their families.   Thank you very much for inviting me to be here today.   - - -","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel marking the 10th anniversary of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation, Auschwitz, 6 December 2019",2019-12-06,"Germany","A.Merkel",1830,"en"
"55","doc97371","Ladies and gentlemen, and, above all, Prof.   Schwab, Youve just mentioned that this is my 12th appearance at this Forum.   You have, for the 50th time, the pleasure of being at this event  -  and not just for one day  - , to prepare it and bring people together.   Id like to congratulate you most sincerely on this achievement.   What has been created here in the Swiss mountains is something unique.   This Forum has set itself the ambitious goal of improving the state of the world and has brought together representatives from politics, business and society time and again to this end  -  not only in Davos, but also in many other places around the world.   I believe that we can claim, if we cast our minds back over the past five decades, that the world has indeed become a better place.   Fifty years ago, we were still in the midst of the Cold War.   Germany was divided.   I couldnt imagine back then that I would one day be standing here.   Its now been 30 years since the Cold War came to an end.   A multipolar world has emerged from a bipolar world that, as we were unable to tell 30 years ago, also has a large number of problems.   Per capita income has more than doubled since 1970.   The number of people suffering extreme poverty has gone down, even though the worlds population has increased dramatically.   We have made tremendous progress in the fight against disease  -  polio, for example.   None of this would ever have been possible with countries just going it alone, but for me this is the result of people, companies and, above all, countries working together.   So this is important, despite the fact that new problems arise year after year, of course.   If you take a look at the World Economic Forums Global Risks Report, you can see very clearly, because this is always highlighted in colour, how the nature of these problems has evolved.   Environmental problems have essentially moved to the forefront of these issues over the last ten years.   The issue of sustainability and a cohesive world are of paramount importance.   Your motto this year, ""Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World"", is therefore a motto that is certainly worth discussing.   We talk a lot about the fact that the international community achieves little together.   Nevertheless, it managed a few years ago to develop and adopt the Sustainable Development Goals for the year 2030.   More than 180 countries accomplished this.   This means that we have a very clear roadmap for this new decade as, at the end of the day, we want to achieve these SDGs.   However, it was clear at the UN summit last September, which took stock of this for the first time, that we have so very much on our plate here and that we will not be able to genuinely achieve all of the Sustainable Development Goals if we continue at the current pace.   That is why I would also like to express my gratitude  -  Prof.   Schwab mentioned this to me just now  -  for the fact that an agreement has been reached with the UN to set up a platform on the issue of oceans.   This is the right way forward, because we need to link up global efforts so that we also have an idea of how fast we are progressing.   UN Secretary-General António Guterres is therefore right to say that ours is a ""decade of action"".   We must act, and we must do so, for example, in the area of biodiversity  -  the vast majority of countries are working on this  -  and, above all  -  and this is also playing a huge role at this years World Economic Forum  -  in the area of climate protection.   The issue of achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement could be about no less than the survival of our continent.   Thats why there is a need for action, because we know that we will not achieve the Paris goals  -  above all the objective of ensuring that global warming does not exceed 1.  5 degrees  -  with the present commitments.   I will therefore focus on what this means in the first part of my speech.   This means that the world must act together  -  this is, after all, an international agreement.   Not everyone is still on board, unfortunately, but many are part of this effort.   And this also means that each country must do its own part.   If we look at Germany, the country that Im representing here, then, after 30 years of German unity, we can say that we find ourselves in a situation in which were doing comparatively well.   We have never had so few unemployed people.   Were spending a great deal of money on research and development.   We have increased our investments.   But all this doesnt reflect what we need to achieve over the next 30 years.   After all, the task of keeping global warming to less than 1.  5 degrees compared with the pre industrial era means, for example, no more and no less for us in Europe than that we must be climate-neutral by 2050.   The vast majority of the countries of the European Union have committed themselves to the objective of climate neutrality.   The Commission President was here yesterday and presented the Green Deal to you.   Europe intends to be the first continent to be CO2 free, i.  e.   emissions-free.   But, ladies and gentlemen, these are, of course, transformations of gigantic, historic proportions.   This transformation essentially means turning our backs on our entire way of doing business and our way of life, to which we have become accustomed in the industrial age, over the next 30 years  -  we have already taken the first steps  -  and transitioning to completely new forms of value creation, which, of course, also include industrial production and which have been informed above all by the digital transformation.   We must also get on top of a second giant transformation.   And we hope that the transformation to a CO2 free economy will intensify thanks to the digital transformation and that the digital transformation can facilitate this development.   I would like to spend a moment telling you about what were doing in Germany and what impact this is having on societies.   This goal of climate neutrality is easier said than done.   Its relatively easy to commit to this when you live in cities.   Its a little easier there than if you live in the country and perhaps run a farm or have to walk long distances to work or have a wind turbine on your doorstep.   Firstly, in recent years we took the decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022, albeit for other reasons of sustainability, namely because we believe that waste management for nuclear power isnt sustainable and that the risks are too great.   Secondly, we have decided to phase out coal-fired power generation by 2038 at the latest  -  if possible by 2035.   Coal still accounts for a very high proportion of Germanys electricity generation  -  around 30 percent.   The phase out is therefore a huge step, especially for the people who mine lignite and who find themselves, in structural terms, in a completely new situation.   However, this is only the smaller part of the story.   If we contemplate transforming the energy supply, i.  e.   first of all the power supply, to make it CO2 emissions-free, then thats one task.   But if we look at Germanys primary energy consumption, we see that electricity accounts for 22 percent while 78 percent of our energy consumption is accounted for by heating, mobility and industrial production.   Lets continue to consider the issue of electricity for a moment.   We have set ourselves the target here of generating 65 percent, or around two thirds, with renewable energies by 2030.   Thats quite a lot for a country where the sun doesnt shine all that often and where the wind blows quite irregularly.   This involves setting up a completely new power line network as the sources of energy production are, of course, mostly located far from where the energy is consumed.   We have also set ourselves the goal of reducing CO2 emissions by a total of 55 percent by 2030 and then reaching 95 percent  -  which is commonly referred to as climate neutrality  -  by 2050.   The transition to renewable energy sources is a mammoth feat in and of itself.   Its unlikely that it will be possible to achieve a 100 percent share of renewable energies in electricity generation  -  we have now reached 42 percent by using resources in our own country  -  because our energy capacity, i.  e.   the efficiency with which we can generate electricity from the wind and sun, isnt very high.   There are regions in the world where this works much better.   Theres still the issue of 78 percent for industrial production, mobility and housing, however.   The concept of ""green hydrogen"" will play a huge role here, although we approach everything with an open mind when it comes to technology.   This will also give rise to completely new connectivities in the world as ""green hydrogen"" can be produced much more efficiently in many other places outside Europe.   But we will also do this in Europe.   This means that  -  and thats why Im delighted that many industrial enterprises have told us that they want to become climate neutral  -  that we must reorganise our processes entirely, such as in steel production, mechanical engineering and other areas.   I had a very interesting discussion just now about the possibilities offered by biotechnology.   It goes without saying that this will also play a huge role in the transformation of all of our supply chains.   This means that we will experience dramatic changes without having to do without the products that we are used to today.   But well have to change the way we look at all of this.   The conditions for this transformation must be put in place at the level of government, and companies must also be prepared to strike out on the path of innovation.   Allow me now to talk to you about Germany.   Were actually a relatively peaceful country.   But there have already been considerable social conflicts between those who feel that its absolutely vital to set out on this path and those who do not.   I want to reiterate that 2050 is 30 years away.   I have clear memories of German reunification, which took place 30 years ago.   You can achieve a great deal in 30 years.   But I also know how short 30 years are if you want to bring about a digital transformation and a transformation of supply chains based on entirely different sources of energy.   Time is therefore of the essence.   That is why we, the older generation, must also make sure  -  Im 65 years old  -  that we embrace young peoples impatience in a positive and constructive way and understand that they have a different horizon that extends far beyond 2050.   This, of course, raises the question as to how we preserve biodiversity and achieve climate compatibility in this world.   This is why were called upon to act.   The aim now is to overcome new social conflicts.   After all, there is, also in Germany, a large group of people who dont consider the whole issue to be all that urgent.   This group isnt yet convinced that this is the most important thing at stake.   How can we get such people on side? Democracies have the task of involving individuals and sparking their enthusiasm.   To my mind, the greatest social tension is between cities and the country, because rural areas bear a much greater burden when faced with changes and urban areas are able to harness change for their own benefit much faster as the infrastructure in cities is superior.   For example, its much easier to do without individual mobility in a city than in the country.   How do you conciliate those who simply dont want to believe in climate change and who act as if it were a question of faith? To my mind, however, this is a classic instance of clear evidence in the light of scientific data.   But since were living at a time when facts are competing with emotions, you can always try to create a post factual world through emotions, which is then just as important.   This therefore means for us that we have to reconcile emotions with facts.   Thats perhaps the biggest task facing society.   In order to address this, it is necessary, as a minimum, to talk to each other.   The irreconcilability and walls of silence that sometimes exist between those who deny climate change and those who see it and are committed to ensuring that we tackle it must be overcome.   Many people are talking to each other on this issue who otherwise rarely speak to each other, but not enough people are talking to each other.   If we enter a world in which the wall of silence is perhaps sometimes even greater than it was during the Cold War, when there were fairly orderly mechanisms of exchange, then we have a problem.   This is why Im in favour, even if this isnt easy, of engaging in dialogue  -  also between groups with the most controversial of opinions  -  because, if we dont, we will only become prisoners of our own prejudices and inhabit our own personal bubble.   This has become much easier in the digital age than it was in previous ages.   This could prove to be our undoing and must be overcome.   I firmly believe that the price for not taking action would be far greater than for taking action.   We want to promote innovation and research and believe that industrialised countries have an obligation here.   For example, the G20 countries produce 80 percent of CO2 emissions.   That means that, in view of the CO2 budget that we have already used up, we have a duty to tread innovative paths in the field of technology.   I was most delighted and, to be honest, surprised to note that Germany took first place in the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index.   Were not the kind of people who spend all day banging on about what works well here, because were mostly focused on what isnt going so well.   Cultures can be different in this respect.   But when it comes to the Bloomberg ranking, then we can allow ourselves to mention this.   Interestingly, this excellent result has a great deal to do with the fact that our automobile industry, which is, after all, a core sector of the German economy, is undergoing a phase of transformation with very high investments in research and development.   It remains to be seen whether were moving fast enough.   The risks are clearly pointed up in this study.   Were focusing as far as possible on market economy mechanisms, and also on regulatory law where this is required.   The biggest and most difficult area of transformation is, as things currently stand, mobility.   The transition to CO2 free mobility is a huge challenge.   We all know that producing batteries and electric cars doesnt reduce CO2 emissions by itself if not all of the batterys components are produced such that they are CO2 neutral.   That means that we still have a vast amount of work to do in this area.   We want to go down the path of innovation in such a way that we ourselves make innovations available.   There is, for example, a surcharge on the price of electricity.   We have the highest electricity prices in Europe because were promoting renewable energies and reflecting these costs in the price of electricity.   Each year, Germanys citizens spend 30 billion euros on subsidies for this electricity because it isnt yet competitive.   However, this has resulted in the fact that we, in the area of technologies at any rate, have come very close to competitiveness in the wind and solar energy sector and are now able to sell and implement these technologies in developing countries because they dont have to shoulder innovation and development costs.   This is enabling countries that are poorer but which have a much lower footprint with regard to CO2 emissions to enter this new era more swiftly.   Germany is now spending twice as much money as in 2014  -  four billion euros per year  -  on investments in international climate protection.   So, ladies and gentlemen, we may ask ourselves: how are things developing outside of Europe? In Europe, there is always more or less a foundation for prosperity.   Yet  -  and this is something I have often talked about in Germany  -  it will be difficult to ensure that everyone is taken on board and that we do not leave any large, reluctant groups behind.   But if we compare this with many other regions around the world, then we know how much more difficult it is to achieve progress in those places  -  because, at the same time, they are struggling with war and peace, as well as difficult economic conditions; and because, in places like Africa and also Asia, they must already grapple with the effects of climate change before they can begin to be sufficiently technologically equipped and use the right methods.   All around the world, people appear to be realising that the digital transformation and challenges in connection with our use of the earths resources are bringing dramatic change  -  whether we admit it or not.   However, in recent years, this has also led to more and more countries looking inward.   Also, tensions between the worlds regions have not exactly decreased.   That is what makes a multipolar environment so challenging  -  precisely because there is tension between the poles and these are constantly changing in strength.   If we look at Chinas GDP thirty years ago, it was much lower than Germanys.   China overtook us in 2007  -  and today Chinas economy is much stronger than ours.   Of course, the ebb and flow of power causes uncertainty.   And this, in turn, creates even more tension.   We must bear this in mind and address the issues that arise.   Today  -  in fact, almost as I speak to you now  -  Holocaust commemoration events are being held in Israel, in Yad Vashem.   Germanys Federal President is there, and he will once again point to the responsibility that we bear for what we brought upon the world.   He will also promise that we will do everything in our power to ensure that something like this never occurs again.   Today, we can look back on 75 years of peaceful coexistence in Europe.   But that is not the case for everyone.   The new year was only a few days old when we were all surprised by mounting tensions in Iran and Iraq.   We were concerned, and we asked ourselves: what is this leading to, and how can we de escalate? Germany is one of the countries that says: if we have imperfect agreements  -  and the nuclear agreement with Iran is certainly an imperfect agreement  -  then lets not throw away something thats not perfect before we have something thats better.   That is why we are campaigning to maintain the nuclear agreement.   However, we did now trigger the dispute resolution mechanism  -  because of course we dont want Iran to get the impression that it is no longer bound by anything.   That would send the wrong message.   We have seen that we cannot simply disconnect from whats going on in the world.   In 2015, Germany and many other European countries took in a large number of refugees.   I have said many times over  -  including, I believe, right here  -  that if you ask where mistakes were made, then the mistake in terms of security was not to take in those people who were standing on our doorstep.   No, the mistake was to not have paid attention from the very beginning, to have not created conditions that enable people to stay in their home country.   In a country like Syria, with just over 20 million inhabitants, half of which have fled their homes  -  either as internally displaced persons or by going abroad  -  and when you see that Turkey is hosting some four million Syrian refugees, that Lebanon has become destabilised, to a significant extent also because of the refugees it has taken in, and how Jordan is suffering under the burden it is bearing, then the only conclusion you can draw is that we must, time and again, do everything we can to set peace processes in motion, no matter how difficult this may be.   We need to make sure that what we are witnessing in Syria does not repeat itself in Libya.   Last weekend, we attempted  -  and its nothing more than that  -  to find a solution for Libya, before the conflict there becomes a proxy war similar to the one people in Syria are burdened with.   With regard to Libya, we are witnessing how the adjacent countries in the Sahel region, which are among the poorest in the world  -  the people of Mali and Niger, at least most of them, cannot dream of ever travelling to Davos  -  are now being plagued by terrorism, because Libya is an unstable state and many weapons are pouring in from there.   We all must make a joint effort  -  and Germany is both trying to do its part and must do more  -  to prevent these countries from becoming completely destabilised.   All development efforts and aid run the risk of becoming ineffective if a country like Niger must already now spend 30 percent of its overall income on its own security  -  in Germany, our discussion is centred on spending a mere two percent on defence  -  30 percent of an already very small budget are being spent for this purpose; and even thats not enough.   The terrorists are still better equipped.   So of course my hope for these countries, when they ask for help, is that we will fight terrorism there the same way we do on our doorstep  -  namely, with a broad coalition that also gets support from the United Nations, with a robust mandate.   After all, they are willing to fight for their countries.   Yet so far, we havent managed to also get them the backing of the United Nations.   If we look at the significance that Syria took on for us in Europe, that means we need to make an even greater preventive effort and be a force for good  -  so that we can either prevent migration flows or succeed in promoting orderly migration.   This is why I am pleased to announce today that we will continue to participate in international aid efforts  -  including the Gavi vaccine alliance.   Between now and 2025, we will again make available 600 million euros towards fighting diseases, improving medical systems and thereby also promoting stability.   At the same time, however, we must of course guarantee security.   Because, without security, there can be no development.   And without development, there can certainly be no security.   Ladies and gentlemen, Germany is part of the European Union; and, as Mr Schwab has pointed out, we will hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union during the second half of this year.   The European Union will undergo substantial change on 31 January.   Until now, countries always joined the organisation.   Luckily, there are still a few that wish to join.   But now one country will be leaving us: the United Kingdom.   This means profound change, but we will come to terms with it.   It was the will of the British people.   We will continue to do everything we can to maintain good, intensive, friendly and good neighbourly relations with the United Kingdom.   Europe  -  and this is in line with Ursula von der Leyen and her new Commissions goal of being a geopolitical Commission  -  must certainly speak with a loud, clear voice.   I think the declared aim of becoming the first CO2 neutral continent is also a good message for the world.   It is equally important to do more in the sphere of development policy and to contribute more to peaceful solutions in this world.   During its Presidency, Germany wants to contribute two things in particular that I want to mention here today.   First, there will be a summit with African countries, which we will hold in Brussels and at which we will above all address Africas agenda.   I am very pleased that we will not only be doing things for Africa, but increasingly doing things with Africa.   Africa has set itself a development agenda.   Last summer, Africa established a free trade zone.   What is more, the African Union has held a summit in Niamey, the capital of Niger  -  which is the poorest country in the world.   A decision was taken to jointly establish a single market.   This will certainly take some time to accomplish, but it is a brave decision.   We should support the Africans in what they envision for their continent, and help them turn this into reality.   What we should not do is keep offering up ideas on what their development should look like.   We should finally understand that being partners on an equal footing with Africa is not only charitable, but can also be mutually enriching.   In Germany, the average age is roughly 45 years  -  whereas in Niger and Mali it is 15 to 16 years.   What does it mean when such a large part of the population is focused on the future? In Germany, weve gotten used to the idea that general progress can be slow, and that there is still enough time.   In other countries, people are under quite a lot more time pressure.   Thats why I say that Europeans only stand to benefit if they focus a little more on Africa and learn from the creativity, motivation and lust for life that people there have, under considerably more difficult circumstances.   Second, we will do something that certainly wont be easy: So far, the European Union has not had a uniform policy on China.   For years, everyone saw China as an interesting trading partner.   At some point, Central and Eastern European countries formed a group and concluded that, if France, Germany and other big countries are constantly meeting with China and striking big deals, then why dont we, too, join forces and have regular meetings with China? For the very first time, we want to have an EU China Summit that includes all 27 member states and that will be held in September in Leipzig, Germany.   At this event, we want to focus on three main issues.   Since 2013, we have been working on an EU China investment agreement.   I can only hope that we will succeed in concluding it in 2020.   But its not certain that we will manage to do that.   It will require flexibility on all sides.   We will talk about how we can jointly tackle climate change.   This is a tremendous opportunity for us, because China, too, is introducing an emissions trading system  -  that is, market-based mechanisms.   If we could interlink the European emissions trading system with that of China, we would have covered a very large part of the world, and this could serve as an example.   We also want to examine relations with third countries.   Here, the focus is once again on Africa, because China is very active in Africa.   We want to step up our engagement, and we hope that we can maybe find common benchmarks that will help the respective countries develop their own economies.   We will, of course, also address a number of European issues.   We have a Digital Agenda.   Just now, during my meeting on the nexus between biotechnology and the digital revolution, I heard again what Ive heard so many times before: Europe is good, especially on how it handles data  -  but Europe is far too slow.   We must overcome this sluggishness  -  because if we dont, we will not become a geopolitical player; we know this is true.   However, with 27 member states, thats not so easy, because each country has a parliament that instructs its Government to pursue certain objectives in Brussels.   But we have no reasonable alternative.   And that is why we want to help move things forward.   As Europeans  -  and Germany is certainly one of the lead countries on this  -  we will also work to promote multilateralism and to strengthen multilateral organisations.   Of course, everyone is free to conclude trade agreements with anyone they wish; the European Union does just that.   Hopefully, we will manage to reach a trade agreement with the United States.   But on the whole, I think the most efficient way to create global prosperity is to have well-functioning multilateral organisations.   These include, for example, the World Trade Organization.   It must be reformed  -  and on this I agree with the American President  -  but it must also again become a functioning organisation.   The fact that we currently have no workable dispute settlement procedure is basically a sign that the organisation is not functioning well.   I will therefore close by repeating the motto under which you are gathering here and now: ""Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World.  "" Thats all of us.   It includes states and politicians.   We should take this task seriously.   I think we have opportunities.   However, if we feel like were faced with too many problems, we must not turn increasingly inward.   That would be the completely wrong lesson to draw 75 years after the end of the Second World War.   Now I know that simply repeating the same messages over and over again will not make them more convincing.   But in my view, this is a good cause to fight for, even though it may be difficult at times.   I know that many among you are fighting to achieve the same goal.   Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak to you.","Speech by Federal Chancellor Merkel at the 2020 Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum on 23 January 2020 in Davos",2020-01-23,"Germany","A.Merkel",4962,"en"
"56","doc97921","Ladies and gentlemen, and, above all, Prof.   Schwab, Youve just mentioned that this is my 12appearance at this Forum.   You have, for the 50time, the pleasure of being at this event  -  and not just for one day  - , to prepare it and bring people together.   Id like to congratulate you most sincerely on this achievement.   What has been created here in the Swiss mountains is something unique.   This Forum has set itself the ambitious goal of improving the state of the world and has brought together representatives from politics, business and society time and again to this end  -  not only in Davos, but also in many other places around the world.   I believe that we can claim, if we cast our minds back over the past five decades, that the world has indeed become a better place.   Fifty years ago, we were still in the midst of the Cold War.   Germany was divided.   I couldnt imagine back then that I would one day be standing here.   Its now been 30 years since the Cold War came to an end.   A multipolar world has emerged from a bipolar world that, as we were unable to tell 30 years ago, also has a large number of problems.   Per-capita income has more than doubled since 1970.   The number of people suffering extreme poverty has gone down, even though the worlds population has increased dramatically.   We have made tremendous progress in the fight against disease  -  polio, for example.   None of this would ever have been possible with countries just going it alone, but for me this is the result of people, companies and, above all, countries working together.   So this is important, despite the fact that new problems arise year after year, of course.   If you take a look at the World Economic Forums Global Risks Report, you can see very clearly, because this is always highlighted in colour, how the nature of these problems has evolved.   Environmental problems have essentially moved to the forefront of these issues over the last ten years.   The issue of sustainability and a cohesive world are of paramount importance.   Your motto this year, ""Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World"", is therefore a motto that is certainly worth discussing.   We talk a lot about the fact that the international community achieves little together.   Nevertheless, it managed a few years ago to develop and adopt the Sustainable Development Goals for the year 2030.   More than 180 countries accomplished this.   This means that we have a very clear roadmap for this new decade as, at the end of the day, we want to achieve these SDGs.   However, it was clear at the UN summit last September, which took stock of this for the first time, that we have so very much on our plate here and that we will not be able to genuinely achieve all of the Sustainable Development Goals if we continue at the current pace.   That is why I would also like to express my gratitude  -  Prof.   Schwab mentioned this to me just now  -  for the fact that an agreement has been reached with the UN to set up a platform on the issue of oceans.   This is the right way forward, because we need to link up global efforts so that we also have an idea of how fast we are progressing.   UN Secretary-General António Guterres is therefore right to say that ours is a ""decade of action"".   We must act, and we must do so, for example, in the area of biodiversity  -  the vast majority of countries are working on this  -  and, above all  -  and this is also playing a huge role at this years World Economic Forum  -  in the area of climate protection.   The issue of achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement could be about no less than the survival of our continent.   Thats why there is a need for action, because we know that we will not achieve the Paris goals  -  above all the objective of ensuring that global warming does not exceed 1.  5 degrees  -  with the present commitments.   I will therefore focus on what this means in the first part of my speech.   This means that the world must act together  -  this is, after all, an international agreement.   Not everyone is still on board, unfortunately, but many are part of this effort.   And this also means that each country must do its own part.   If we look at Germany, the country that Im representing here, then, after 30 years of German unity, we can say that we find ourselves in a situation in which were doing comparatively well.   We have never had so few unemployed people.   Were spending a great deal of money on research and development.   We have increased our investments.   But all this doesnt reflect what we need to achieve over the next 30 years.   After all, the task of keeping global warming to less than 1.  5 degrees compared with the pre-industrial era means, for example, no more and no less for us in Europe than that we must be climate-neutral by 2050.   The vast majority of the countries of the European Union have committed themselves to the objective of climate neutrality.   The Commission President was here yesterday and presented the Green Deal to you.   Europe intends to be the first continent to be CO -free, i.  e.   emissions-free.   But, ladies and gentlemen, these are, of course, transformations of gigantic, historic proportions.   This transformation essentially means turning our backs on our entire way of doing business and our way of life, to which we have become accustomed in the industrial age, over the next 30 years  -  we have already taken the first steps  -  and transitioning to completely new forms of value creation, which, of course, also include industrial production and which have been informed above all by the digital transformation.   We must also get on top of a second giant transformation.   And we hope that the transformation to a CO -free economy will intensify thanks to the digital transformation and that the digital transformation can facilitate this development.   I would like to spend a moment telling you about what were doing in Germany and what impact this is having on societies.   This goal of climate neutrality is easier said than done.   Its relatively easy to commit to this when you live in cities.   Its a little easier there than if you live in the country and perhaps run a farm or have to walk long distances to work or have a wind turbine on your doorstep.   Firstly, in recent years we took the decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022, albeit for other reasons of sustainability, namely because we believe that waste management for nuclear power isnt sustainable and that the risks are too great.   Secondly, we have decided to phase out coal-fired power generation by 2038 at the latest  -  if possible by 2035.   Coal still accounts for a very high proportion of Germanys electricity generation  -  around 30 percent.   The phase-out is therefore a huge step, especially for the people who mine lignite and who find themselves, in structural terms, in a completely new situation.   However, this is only the smaller part of the story.   If we contemplate transforming the energy supply, i.  e.   first of all the power supply, to make it CO emissions-free, then thats one task.   But if we look at Germanys primary energy consumption, we see that electricity accounts for 22 percent while 78 percent of our energy consumption is accounted for by heating, mobility and industrial production.   Lets continue to consider the issue of electricity for a moment.   We have set ourselves the target here of generating 65 percent, or around two thirds, with renewable energies by 2030.   Thats quite a lot for a country where the sun doesnt shine all that often and where the wind blows quite irregularly.   This involves setting up a completely new power line network as the sources of energy production are, of course, mostly located far from where the energy is consumed.   We have also set ourselves the goal of reducing COemissions by a total of 55 percent by 2030 and then reaching 95 percent  -  which is commonly referred to as climate neutrality  -  by 2050.   The transition to renewable energy sources is a mammoth feat in and of itself.   Its unlikely that it will be possible to achieve a 100 percent share of renewable energies in electricity generation  -  we have now reached 42 percent by using resources in our own country  -  because our energy capacity, i.  e.   the efficiency with which we can generate electricity from the wind and sun, isnt very high.   There are regions in the world where this works much better.   Theres still the issue of 78 percent for industrial production, mobility and housing, however.   The concept of ""green hydrogen"" will play a huge role here, although we approach everything with an open mind when it comes to technology.   This will also give rise to completely new connectivities in the world as ""green hydrogen"" can be produced much more efficiently in many other places outside Europe.   But we will also do this in Europe.   This means that  -  and thats why Im delighted that many industrial enterprises have told us that they want to become climate neutral  -  that we must reorganise our processes entirely, such as in steel production, mechanical engineering and other areas.   I had a very interesting discussion just now about the possibilities offered by biotechnology.   It goes without saying that this will also play a huge role in the transformation of all of our supply chains.   This means that we will experience dramatic changes without having to do without the products that we are used to today.   But well have to change the way we look at all of this.   The conditions for this transformation must be put in place at the level of government, and companies must also be prepared to strike out on the path of innovation.   Allow me now to talk to you about Germany.   Were actually a relatively peaceful country.   But there have already been considerable social conflicts between those who feel that its absolutely vital to set out on this path and those who do not.   I want to reiterate that 2050 is 30 years away.   I have clear memories of German reunification, which took place 30 years ago.   You can achieve a great deal in 30 years.   But I also know how short 30 years are if you want to bring about a digital transformation and a transformation of supply chains based on entirely different sources of energy.   Time is therefore of the essence.   That is why we, the older generation, must also make sure  -  Im 65 years old  -  that we embrace young peoples impatience in a positive and constructive way and understand that they have a different horizon that extends far beyond 2050.   This, of course, raises the question as to how we preserve biodiversity and achieve climate compatibility in this world.   This is why were called upon to act.   The aim now is to overcome new social conflicts.   After all, there is, also in Germany, a large group of people who dont consider the whole issue to be all that urgent.   This group isnt yet convinced that this is the most important thing at stake.   How can we get such people on side? Democracies have the task of involving individuals and sparking their enthusiasm.   To my mind, the greatest social tension is between cities and the country, because rural areas bear a much greater burden when faced with changes and urban areas are able to harness change for their own benefit much faster as the infrastructure in cities is superior.   For example, its much easier to do without individual mobility in a city than in the country.   How do you conciliate those who simply dont want to believe in climate change and who act as if it were a question of faith? To my mind, however, this is a classic instance of clear evidence in the light of scientific data.   But since were living at a time when facts are competing with emotions, you can always try to create a post-factual world through emotions, which is then just as important.   This therefore means for us that we have to reconcile emotions with facts.   Thats perhaps the biggest task facing society.   In order to address this, it is necessary, as a minimum, to talk to each other.   The irreconcilability and walls of silence that sometimes exist between those who deny climate change and those who see it and are committed to ensuring that we tackle it must be overcome.   Many people are talking to each other on this issue who otherwise rarely speak to each other, but not enough people are talking to each other.   If we enter a world in which the wall of silence is perhaps sometimes even greater than it was during the Cold War, when there were fairly orderly mechanisms of exchange, then we have a problem.   This is why Im in favour, even if this isnt easy, of engaging in dialogue  -  also between groups with the most controversial of opinions  -  because, if we dont, we will only become prisoners of our own prejudices and inhabit our own personal bubble.   This has become much easier in the digital age than it was in previous ages.   This could prove to be our undoing and must be overcome.   I firmly believe that the price for not taking action would be far greater than for taking action.   We want to promote innovation and research and believe that industrialised countries have an obligation here.   For example, the G20 countries produce 80 percent of COemissions.   That means that, in view of the CObudget that we have already used up, we have a duty to tread innovative paths in the field of technology.   I was most delighted and, to be honest, surprised to note that Germany took first place in the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index.   Were not the kind of people who spend all day banging on about what works well here, because were mostly focused on what isnt going so well.   Cultures can be different in this respect.   But when it comes to the Bloomberg ranking, then we can allow ourselves to mention this.   Interestingly, this excellent result has a great deal to do with the fact that our automobile industry, which is, after all, a core sector of the German economy, is undergoing a phase of transformation with very high investments in research and development.   It remains to be seen whether were moving fast enough.   The risks are clearly pointed up in this study.   Were focusing as far as possible on market economy mechanisms, and also on regulatory law where this is required.   The biggest and most difficult area of transformation is, as things currently stand, mobility.   The transition to CO -free mobility is a huge challenge.   We all know that producing batteries and electric cars doesnt reduce COemissions by itself if not all of the batterys components are produced such that they are CO -neutral.   That means that we still have a vast amount of work to do in this area.   We want to go down the path of innovation in such a way that we ourselves make innovations available.   There is, for example, a surcharge on the price of electricity.   We have the highest electricity prices in Europe because were promoting renewable energies and reflecting these costs in the price of electricity.   Each year, Germanys citizens spend 30 billion euros on subsidies for this electricity because it isnt yet competitive.   However, this has resulted in the fact that we, in the area of technologies at any rate, have come very close to competitiveness in the wind and solar energy sector and are now able to sell and implement these technologies in developing countries because they dont have to shoulder innovation and development costs.   This is enabling countries that are poorer but which have a much lower footprint with regard to COemissions to enter this new era more swiftly.   Germany is now spending twice as much money as in 2014  -  four billion euros per year  -  on investments in international climate protection.   So, ladies and gentlemen, we may ask ourselves: how are things developing outside of Europe? In Europe, there is always more or less a foundation for prosperity.   Yet  -  and this is something I have often talked about in Germany  -  it will be difficult to ensure that everyone is taken on board and that we do not leave any large, reluctant groups behind.   But if we compare this with many other regions around the world, then we know how much more difficult it is to achieve progress in those places  -  because, at the same time, they are struggling with war and peace, as well as difficult economic conditions; and because, in places like Africa and also Asia, they must already grapple with the effects of climate change before they can begin to be sufficiently technologically equipped and use the right methods.   All around the world, people appear to be realising that the digital transformation and challenges in connection with our use of the earths resources are bringing dramatic change  -  whether we admit it or not.   However, in recent years, this has also led to more and more countries looking inward.   Also, tensions between the worlds regions have not exactly decreased.   That is what makes a multipolar environment so challenging  -  precisely because there is tension between the poles and these are constantly changing in strength.   If we look at Chinas GDP thirty years ago, it was much lower than Germanys.   China overtook us in 2007  -  and today Chinas economy is much stronger than ours.   Of course, the ebb and flow of power causes uncertainty.   And this, in turn, creates even more tension.   We must bear this in mind and address the issues that arise.   Today  -  in fact, almost as I speak to you now  -  Holocaust commemoration events are being held in Israel, in Yad Vashem.   Germanys Federal President is there, and he will once again point to the responsibility that we bear for what we brought upon the world.   He will also promise that we will do everything in our power to ensure that something like this never occurs again.   Today, we can look back on 75 years of peaceful coexistence in Europe.   But that is not the case for everyone.   The new year was only a few days old when we were all surprised by mounting tensions in Iran and Iraq.   We were concerned, and we asked ourselves: what is this leading to, and how can we de-escalate? Germany is one of the countries that says: if we have imperfect agreements  -  and the nuclear agreement with Iran is certainly an imperfect agreement  -  then lets not throw away something thats not perfect before we have something thats better.   That is why we are campaigning to maintain the nuclear agreement.   However, we did now trigger the dispute resolution mechanism  -  because of course we dont want Iran to get the impression that it is no longer bound by anything.   That would send the wrong message.   We have seen that we cannot simply disconnect from whats going on in the world.   In 2015, Germany and many other European countries took in a large number of refugees.   I have said many times over  -  including, I believe, right here  -  that if you ask where mistakes were made, then the mistake in terms of security was not to take in those people who were standing on our doorstep.   No, the mistake was to not have paid attention from the very beginning, to have not created conditions that enable people to stay in their home country.   In a country like Syria, with just over 20 million inhabitants, half of which have fled their homes  -  either as internally displaced persons or by going abroad  -  and when you see that Turkey is hosting some four million Syrian refugees, that Lebanon has become destabilised, to a significant extent also because of the refugees it has taken in, and how Jordan is suffering under the burden it is bearing, then the only conclusion you can draw is that we must, time and again, do everything we can to set peace processes in motion, no matter how difficult this may be.   We need to make sure that what we are witnessing in Syria does not repeat itself in Libya.   Last weekend, we attempted  -  and its nothing more than that  -  to find a solution for Libya, before the conflict there becomes a proxy war similar to the one people in Syria are burdened with.   With regard to Libya, we are witnessing how the adjacent countries in the Sahel region, which are among the poorest in the world  -  the people of Mali and Niger, at least most of them, cannot dream of ever travelling to Davos  -  are now being plagued by terrorism, because Libya is an unstable state and many weapons are pouring in from there.   We all must make a joint effort  -  and Germany is both trying to do its part and must do more  -  to prevent these countries from becoming completely destabilised.   All development efforts and aid run the risk of becoming ineffective if a country like Niger must already now spend 30 percent of its overall income on its own security  -  in Germany, our discussion is centred on spending a mere two percent on defence  -  30 percent of an already very small budget are being spent for this purpose; and even thats not enough.   The terrorists are still better equipped.   So of course my hope for these countries, when they ask for help, is that we will fight terrorism there the same way we do on our doorstep  -  namely, with a broad coalition that also gets support from the United Nations, with a robust mandate.   After all, they are willing to fight for their countries.   Yet so far, we havent managed to also get them the backing of the United Nations.   If we look at the significance that Syria took on for us in Europe, that means we need to make an even greater preventive effort and be a force for good  -  so that we can either prevent migration flows or succeed in promoting orderly migration.   This is why I am pleased to announce today that we will continue to participate in international aid efforts  -  including the Gavi vaccine alliance.   Between now and 2025, we will again make available 600 million euros towards fighting diseases, improving medical systems and thereby also promoting stability.   At the same time, however, we must of course guarantee security.   Because, without security, there can be no development.   And without development, there can certainly be no security.   Ladies and gentlemen, Germany is part of the European Union; and, as Mr Schwab has pointed out, we will hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union during the second half of this year.   The European Union will undergo substantial change on 31 January.   Until now, countries always joined the organisation.   Luckily, there are still a few that wish to join.   But now one country will be leaving us: the United Kingdom.   This means profound change, but we will come to terms with it.   It was the will of the British people.   We will continue to do everything we can to maintain good, intensive, friendly and good neighbourly relations with the United Kingdom.   Europe  -  and this is in line with Ursula von der Leyen and her new Commissions goal of being a geopolitical Commission  -  must certainly speak with a loud, clear voice.   I think the declared aim of becoming the first COneutral continent is also a good message for the world.   It is equally important to do more in the sphere of development policy and to contribute more to peaceful solutions in this world.   During its Presidency, Germany wants to contribute two things in particular that I want to mention here today.   First, there will be a summit with African countries, which we will hold in Brussels and at which we will above all address Africas agenda.   I am very pleased that we will not only be doing things Africa, but increasingly doing things Africa.   Africa has set itself a development agenda.   Last summer, Africa established a free trade zone.   What is more, the African Union has held a summit in Niamey, the capital of Niger  -  which is the poorest country in the world.   A decision was taken to jointly establish a single market.   This will certainly take some time to accomplish, but it is a brave decision.   We should support the Africans in what they envision for their continent, and help them turn this into reality.   What we should not do is keep offering up ideas on what their development should look like.   We should finally understand that being partners on an equal footing with Africa is not only charitable, but can also be mutually enriching.   In Germany, the average age is roughly 45 years  -  whereas in Niger and Mali it is 15 to 16 years.   What does it mean when such a large part of the population is focused on the future? In Germany, weve gotten used to the idea that general progress can be slow, and that there is still enough time.   In other countries, people are under quite a lot more time pressure.   Thats why I say that Europeans only stand to benefit if they focus a little more on Africa and learn from the creativity, motivation and lust for life that people there have, under considerably more difficult circumstances.   Second, we will do something that certainly wont be easy: So far, the European Union has not had a uniform policy on China.   For years, everyone saw China as an interesting trading partner.   At some point, Central and Eastern European countries formed a group and concluded that, if France, Germany and other big countries are constantly meeting with China and striking big deals, then why dont we, too, join forces and have regular meetings with China? For the very first time, we want to have an EU-China Summit that includes all 27 member states and that will be held in September in Leipzig, Germany.   At this event, we want to focus on three main issues.   Since 2013, we have been working on an EU-China investment agreement.   I can only hope that we will succeed in concluding it in 2020.   But its not certain that we will manage to do that.   It will require flexibility on all sides.   We will talk about how we can jointly tackle climate change.   This is a tremendous opportunity for us, because China, too, is introducing an emissions trading system  -  that is, market-based mechanisms.

We also want to examine relations with third countries.   Here, the focus is once again on Africa, because China is very active in Africa.   We want to step up our engagement, and we hope that we can maybe find common benchmarks that will help the respective countries develop their own economies.   We will, of course, also address a number of European issues.   We have a Digital Agenda.   Just now, during my meeting on the nexus between biotechnology and the digital revolution, I heard again what Ive heard so many times before: Europe is good, especially on how it handles data  -  but Europe is far too slow.   We must overcome this sluggishness  -  because if we dont, we will not become a geopolitical player; we know this is true.   However, with 27 member states, thats not so easy, because each country has a parliament that instructs its Government to pursue certain objectives in Brussels.   But we have no reasonable alternative.   And that is why we want to help move things forward.   As Europeans  -  and Germany is certainly one of the lead countries on this  -  we will also work to promote multilateralism and to strengthen multilateral organisations.   Of course, everyone is free to conclude trade agreements with anyone they wish; the European Union does just that.   Hopefully, we will manage to reach a trade agreement with the United States.   But on the whole, I think the most efficient way to create global prosperity is to have well-functioning multilateral organisations.   These include, for example, the World Trade Organization.   It must be reformed  -  and on this I agree with the American President  -  but it must also again become a functioning organisation.

However, if we feel like were faced with too many problems, we must not turn increasingly inward.   That would be the completely wrong lesson to draw 75 years after the end of the Second World War.   Now I know that simply repeating the same messages over and over again will not make them more convincing.   But in my view, this is a good cause to fight for, even though it may be difficult at times.   I know that many among you are fighting to achieve the same goal.

"57","doc97911","Secretary-General, António Guterres, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, Svenja Schulze, Allow me to offer you a very warm welcome.   Im delighted to be part of the Petersberg Climate Dialogue once again this year.   2020 was supposed to be the year of biodiversity and climate protection.   Right now, however, were witnessing each day how profoundly the COVID-19 pandemic is changing the way in which we live and work together.   Yet  -  this is what I firmly believe  -  we mustnt lose sight of the fact that we continue to face other major challenges for humanity.   2020 must therefore, despite everything, be the year of biodiversity and climate protection.   In order to ensure that this is successful, its vitally important to continue the Petersberg Climate Dialogue particularly now.   I would like to thank all those involved  -  especially those from the UK  -  that we are able to hold this climate dialogue under these unique circumstances.   The next UN Climate Conference  -  COP26  -  will, after all, take place under the auspices of the UK Presidency.   The COVID-19 pandemic is reminding us once again  -  albeit in a particularly painful way  -  of how vital international cooperation is.   In our closely interconnected world, the national good always depends on the global good at the end of the day.   Whether the coronavirus crisis, or the economic, financial or climate crisis  -  in all great challenges, the more we act together, the better we are able to avoid or mitigate human suffering and economic upheaval.   Ladies and gentlemen, we have seen a reduction in emissions harmful to the climate in most recent times.   But, of course, we mustnt allow ourselves to be deceived as this is essentially due to the shutdown of our public and economic lives.   It therefore continues to be our task and we continue to have a responsibility to implement the Paris Climate Agreement with all due seriousness and determination.   We continue to be called upon to improve national contributions by 2030, to develop long-term strategies for the period up to 2050 and to come up with a concept for climate financing to this end.   The European Commission has shown us the way with its Green Deal, in the course of which Europe is to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.   We know that the path to get there is long.   I therefore welcome the proposed interim target of reducing emissions in the European Union to 50 to 55 percent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels.   We need a comprehensive package of measures to this end.   This includes investments in climate-friendly infrastructures and also appropriate carbon pricing.   I welcome the planned extension of EU emissions trading to other sectors.   In Germany, we decided last year to introduce carbon pricing also in the fields of transport and heating.   We are thereby increasing incentives for both companies and private households alike to make investments in order to reduce COemissions and therefore COcosts in the future.   Germany will phase out coal-based power generation by 2038.   This will entail truly far-reaching structural change for certain regions in Germany.   We will invest particularly heavily in these regions in order to have climate protection create new economic prospects and therefore jobs for people.   We will continue to promote the expansion of renewable energies.   The aim is for renewable energies to account for 65 percent of the total by 2030.   We dont just want to think of ourselves, but also to drive forward international cooperation.   We are setting aside four billion euros for international climate financing this year, which means that we have doubled our commitment since 2014.   We have already increased our contribution to the Green Climate Fund to 1.  5 billion euros.   And also after 2020, Germany will do its part to support international climate financing in line with the Paris Climate Agreement.   Let me say once again that we face difficult discussions about distribution with a view to our respective national budgets if we consider the economic damage that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused.   It will therefore be all the more important, when launching economic stimulus packages, that we keep climate protection very firmly in view and make it clear that were not cutting back on climate protection, but rather that were investing in sustainable technologies  -  that were not only thinking of ourselves in national terms, but that were continuing to make robust progress as regards our international obligations because this is essential to ensuring that we meet with success in climate protection at the global level.   In order to do justice to the joint Paris Climate Agreement, everyone in the international community must do their part, of course.   We must move away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energies and greater energy efficiency.   We believe and I believe that market economy incentives are most important in this regard and that we need carbon pricing.   It would be wonderful if as many of the worlds countries as possible could take this approach.   After all, carbon pricing is the most efficient way to reduce emissions.   And participation across the board helps, of course, to prevent market distortions that could emerge if only individual countries sign up to such a system.   Overall, its important for investors to be able to see that investing in modern technologies pays off.   This applies not least to renewable energies.   The wind and sun are available everywhere as sources of energy.   However, its often the case that theyre unfeasible owing to capital costs.   We therefore need a financial market that makes cheap capital available for climate-friendly investments.   As many stakeholders as possible should work together in this context  -  countries, development banks, and also the private financial sector.   Economy and ecology must be thought of as two sides of the same coin.   And it goes without saying that we must also do this with a view to biodiversity.   We know that natural habitats are shrinking.   This is having a severe impact on biodiversity, and is also posing a threat for us humans in turn.   Allow me to mention one example: according to scientists, 60 percent of all infectious diseases in recent decades have been transmitted from animals to humans.   This is due to the increased exploitation of hitherto undisturbed habitats and the resulting proximity to wild animals.   We therefore have no alternative but to make progress in the international protection of biodiversity and forests.   We need a new framework for the protection of biodiversity in the run-up to the 15UN conference to implement the Convention on Biological Diversity.   Ladies and gentlemen, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda  -  which include healthcare and climate protection  -  make it clear that there can be no sustainable development at the expense of individual SDGs, but that we must bear all of them in mind at all times.   Like all of the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda, we can only successfully overcome the challenge of climate protection at the end of the day by taking firm action at the national level and by working together at the international level.   I would like to ask all of you for your support, and I hope that this conference will show the world that climate protection and biodiversity are, particularly at this time of worldwide crisis during the pandemic, of paramount importance.   I would like to thank everyone involved in this endeavour.   It has been a privilege to speak to you today.   Thank you very much.   - - -","Speech by Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel at the XIth Petersberg Climate Dialogue on 28 April 2020 (video conference)",2020-04-28,"Germany","A.Merkel",1222,"en"
